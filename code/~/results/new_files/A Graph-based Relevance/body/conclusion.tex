\section{Conclusion}
In this paper, we introduced a new ad-hoc retrieval approach GRMM which explicitly incorporates document-level word relationships into the matching function. The flexible graph structure allows the model to find more comprehensive matching patterns and less noises. GRMM exceedingly advances the performance over various baselines, where it empirically witnesses an increment by a large margin on longer documents. Further studies exhibited the rationality and effectiveness of GRMM. There are also possible extensions, such as training with large click logs \cite{jiang2016learning} and query descriptions. Another interesting future work is to extend the current graph with lexical or knowledge graphs which might contain more useful information.
