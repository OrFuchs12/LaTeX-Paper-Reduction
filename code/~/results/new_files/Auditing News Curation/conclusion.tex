\section{Conclusion}
This paper introduced, motivated, and applied an audit framework for news curation systems. We showed how a system's mechanism and content have personal, political, and economic implications in society, and developed a specific research framework accordingly. To demonstrate this framework, we focused on Apple News. To our knowledge, we are the first to analyze this platform in-depth. We employed several audit methods to analyze the app's update frequency, content adaptation, source concentration, and more. Results showed that the human-curated Top Stories section features fewer stories per day and exhibits greater source diversity and greater source evenness compared to the algorithmically-curated Trending Stories section. We discussed how these differences in mechanism and content reflect differences between the algorithmic and editorial curation logics underpinning the two sections.  We offer our framework for reuse, revision, and elaboration to any researchers studying sociotechnical news curation systems.
