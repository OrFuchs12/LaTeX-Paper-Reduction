abstract = {This article responds to recent debates in critical algorithm studies about the significance of the term âalgorithm.â Where some have suggested that critical scholars should align their use of the term with its common definition in professional computer science, I argue that we should instead approach algorithms as âmultiplesââunstable objects that are enacted through the varied practices that people use to engage with them, including the practices of âoutsiderâ researchers. This approach builds on the work of Laura Devendorf, Elizabeth Goodman, and Annemarie Mol. Different ways of enacting algorithms foreground certain issues while occluding others: computer scientists enact algorithms as conceptual objects indifferent to implementation details, while calls for accountability enact algorithms as closed boxes to be opened. I propose that critical researchers might seek to enact algorithms ethnographically, seeing them as heterogeneous and diffuse sociotechnical systems, rather than rigidly constrained and...},

abstract = {Contextual advertising or Context Match (CM) refers to the placement of commercial textual advertisements within the content of a generic web page, while Sponsored Search (SS) advertising consists in placing ads on result pages from a web search engine, with ads driven by the originating query. In CM there is usually an intermediary commercial ad-network entity in charge of optimizing the ad selection with the twin goal of increasing revenue (shared between the publisher and the ad-network) and improving the user experience. With these goals in mind it is preferable to have ads relevant to the page content, rather than generic ads. The SS market developed quicker than the CM market, and most textual ads are still characterized by "bid phrases" representing those queries where the advertisers would like to have their ad displayed. Hence, the first technologies for CM have relied on previous solutions for SS, by simply extracting one or more phrases from the given page content , and displaying ads corresponding to searches on these phrases, in a purely syntactic approach. However, due to the vagaries of phrase extraction, and the lack of context, this approach leads to many irrelevant ads. To overcome this problem, we propose a system for contextual ad matching based on a combination of semantic and syntactic features.},

@techreport{Chouldechova2018,
abstract = {Every year there are more than 3.6 mil-lion referrals made to child protection agen-cies across the US. The practice of screen-ing calls is left to each jurisdiction to fol-low local practices and policies, potentially leading to large variation in the way in which referrals are treated across the coun-try. Whilst increasing access to linked ad-ministrative data is available, it is difficult for welfare workers to make systematic use of historical information about all the chil-dren and adults on a single referral call. Risk prediction models that use routinely collected administrative data can help call workers to better identify cases that are likely to result in adverse outcomes. How-ever, the use of predictive analytics in the area of child welfare is contentious. There is a possibility that some communitiesâ such as those in poverty or from particu-lar racial and ethnic groupsâwill be dis-advantaged by the reliance on government administrative data. On the other hand, these analytics tools can augment or re-place human judgments, which themselves are biased and imperfect. In this paper we describe our work on developing, validat-ing, fairness auditing, and deploying a risk prediction model in Allegheny County, PA, USA. We discuss the results of our analy-sis to-date, and also highlight key problems and data bias issues that present challenges for model evaluation and deployment.},

abstract = {We develop a model with many advertisers (products) and many advertising markets (media). Each advertiser sells to a different segment of consumers, and each medium is targeting a different audience. We characterize the competitive equilibrium in the advertising markets and evaluate the implications of targeting. An increase in targeting leads to an increase in the total number of consumer-product matches, and hence in the social value of advertising. Yet, targeting also increases the concentration of firms advertising in each market. Surprisingly, we then find that the equilibrium price of advertisements is first increasing, then decreasing, in the targeting capacity. We trace out the implications of targeting for competing media. We distinguish offline and online media by their targeting ability: low versus high. As consumers' relative exposure to online media increases, the revenues of offline media decrease, even though the price of advertising might increase.},

Preexisting bias has its roots in social institutions, practices, and attitudes. Technical bias arises from technical constraints or considerations. Emergent bias arises in a context of use. Although others have pointed to bias in particular computer systems and have noted the general problem, we know of no com- parable work that examines this phenomenon comprehensively and which offers a framework for understanding and remedying it. We conclude by suggesting that freedom from bias should be counted among the select set of criteriaâincluding reliability, accuracy, and efficiencyâ according to which the quality of systems in use in society should be judged.},

This includes a large number of dating college students as well as couples who are geographically-separated because of situational demands such as work. We conducted interviews with individuals in LDRs to understand how they make use of video chat systems to maintain their relationships. In particular, we have investigated how couples use video to "hang out" together and engage in activities over extended periods of time. Our results show that regardless of the relationship situation, video chat affords a unique opportunity for couples to share presence over distance, which in turn provides intimacy. While beneficial, couples still face challenges in using video chat, including contextual (e.g., location of partners, time zones), technical (e.g., mobility, audio/video quality, networking), and personal (e.g., a lack of physicality needed by most for intimate sexual acts) challenges.},

abstract = {During the past decade, the Internet has become an important news source for the majority of Americans. According to a study conducted by the Pew Internet and American Life Project, as of January 2010, nearly 61{\%} of Americans got at least some of their news online in a typical day. This increased reliance on the Internet as a source of news has coincided with declining profits in the traditional media and the shuttering of newsrooms in communities across the country. Some commentators look at this confluence of events and assert that, in this case, correlation equals causation â the Internet is harming the news business. One explanation for the decline of the traditional media that some, including News Corporation owner Rupert Murdoch and Associated Press Chairman Dean Singleton, have seized upon is the rise of the news aggregator. According to this theory, news aggregators from Google News to The Huffington Post are free-riding, reselling and profiting from the factual information gathered by traditional media organizations at great cost. Murdoch has gone so far as to call Google's aggregation and display of newspaper headlines and ledes âtheft.â As the traditional media are quick to point out, the legality of a business model built around the monetization of third-party content isn't merely an academic question â it's big business. Revenues generated from online advertising totaled {\$}23.4 billion in 2008 alone. But for all of the heated rhetoric blaming news aggregators for the decline of journalism, many are still left asking the question: are news aggregators violating current law? This white paper attempts to answer that question by examining the hot news misappropriation and copyright infringement claims that are often asserted against aggregators, and to provide news aggregators with some "best practices" for making use of third-party content.},

abstract = {While Wikipedia is a subject of great interest in the com-puting literature, very little work has considered Wikipedia's important relationships with other information technologies like search engines. In this paper, we report the results of two deception studies whose goal was to better understand the critical relationship between Wikipedia and Google. These studies silently removed Wikipedia content from Google search results and examined the effect of doing so on partici-pants' interactions with both websites. Our findings demon-strate and characterize an extensive interdependence between Wikipedia and Google. Google becomes a worse search en-gine for many queries when it cannot surface Wikipedia con-tent (e.g. click-through rates on results pages drop signifi-cantly) and the importance of Wikipedia content is likely greater than many improvements to search algorithms. Our results also highlight Google's critical role in providing read-ership to Wikipedia. However, we also found evidence that this mutually beneficial relationship is in jeopardy: changes Google has made to its search results that involve directly surfacing Wikipedia content are significantly reducing traffic to Wikipedia. Overall, our findings argue that researchers and practitioners should give deeper consideration to the interde-pendence between peer production communities and the in-formation technologies that use and surface their content.},

Canvas fingerprinting, a recently developed form of browser fingerprinting, has not previously been reported in the wild; our results show that over 5{\%} of the top 100,000 websites employ it. We then present the first automated study of evercookies and respawning and the discovery of a new evercookie vector, IndexedDB. Turning to cookie syncing, we present novel techniques for detection and analysing ID flows and we quantify the amplification of privacy-intrusive tracking practices due to cookie syncing. Our evaluation of the defensive techniques used by privacy-aware users finds that there exist subtle pitfalls-such as failing to clear state on multiple browsers at once-in which a single lapse in judgement can shatter privacy defenses. This suggests that even sophisticated users face great difficulties in evading tracking techniques.},

We investigate the intrinsic value of location data in the context of strong privacy , where location information is only available from end users via purchase. We present an algorithm to compute the expected value of location data from a user, without access to the specific coordinates of the location data point. We use decision-theoretic techniques to provide a principled way for a potential buyer to make purchasing decisions about private user location data. We illustrate our approach in two scenarios: the delivery of targeted ads specific to a user's home location and the estimation of traffic speed. In both cases, the methodology leads to quantifiably better purchasing decisions than competing methods.

abstract = {Online advertising is one of the primary sources of funding for content , services, and applications on both web and mobile platforms. Mobile in-app advertisements are implemented on top of existing web technologies with the same ad-serving model (i.e., users-publishers ad networks-advertisers). Even so, in-app advertising is different from traditional web advertising. For example, malicious mobile app developers can generate fraudulent ad clicks in an automated fashion, but malicious web publishers have to leverage bots to launch click fraud. In spite of using the same underlying web infrastructure, these ad threats behave differently on different platforms. Existing works have separately studied click fraud and malvertis-ing in mobile settings. However, it is not known if there is a strong relationship between these two dominant threats. In this paper, we develop an ad collection framework-MAdLife-on Android to capture all in-app ad traffic generated during each ad's entire lifespan. We revisit both threats in a fine-grained manner with MAdLife to determine the relationship between them. Furthermore, MAdLife also allows us to explore other threats related to landing pages. We analyzed 5.7K Android apps crawled from Google Play store, and collected 83K ads and their landing pages with MAdLife. 58K ads land on a web page, which is similar to traditional web ads. We discovered 37 click-fraud apps, and revealed that 1.49{\%} of the 58K ads are related to malvertising. We also found a strong correlation between fraudulent apps and malicious ads. Specifically, over 15.44{\%} of malicious ads originate from the fraudulent apps. Conversely, 18.36{\%} of the ads displayed in the fraudulent apps are malicious, compared to only 1.28{\%} found in the rest apps. Due to fraudulent apps, users are much more (14x) likely to encounter malvertising ads. Additionally, we discovered 243 popular JavaScript snippets embedded by over 10{\%} of the landing pages are malicious. Finally, we also present the first analysis on inappropriate mobile in-app ads.

abstract = {For much of the 20th century newspaper advertising expenditures experienced strong and regular growth and a close link between that advertising spending and gross domestic product (GDP) was observable. Using a US dataset from 1950 to 2005, this paper explores advertising growth trends, the extent to which the relationship between GDP and newspaper advertising expenditures is being maintained, and changes in expenditures in different categories (retail, classified, and national) to determine whether and how the long-term trends are shifting. The author finds that the relationship between GDP and expenditures is weakening, that growth is not keeping pace with inflation, and that there is greater volatility in advertising than seen in the past. The author concludes that trends indicate the advertising expenditures will plateau and decline in the future, denying newspapers revenue growth that is critically needed for sustainability.

abstract = {preferences against others, suggesting new or forgotten bits of culture for us to encounter. Algorithms manage our interactions on social networking sites, highlighting the news of one friend while excluding another's. Algorithms designed to calculate what is "hot" or "trending" or "most discussed" skim the cream from the seemingly boundless chatter that's on offer. Together, these algorithms not only help us find information, they provide a means to know what there is to know and how to know it, to participate in social and political discourse, and to familiarize ourselves with the publics in which we participate. They are now a key logic governing the flows of information on which we depend, with the "power to enable and assign meaningfulness, managing how information is perceived by users, the 'distribution of the sensible.'" (Langlois 2012) Algorithms need not be software: in the broadest sense, they are encoded procedures for transforming input data into a desired output, based on specified calculations. The procedures name both a problem and the steps by which it should be solved. Instructions for navigation may be considered an algorithm, or the mathematical formulas required to predict the movement of a celestial body across the sky. "Algorithms do things, and their syntax embodies a command structure to enable this to happen" (Goffey 2008, 17). We might think of computers, then, fundamentally as algorithm machines-designed to store and read data, apply mathematical procedures to it in a controlled fashion, and offer new information as the output. But these are procedures that could conceivably be done by hand-and in fact were (Light 1999). But as we have embraced computational tools as our primary media of expression, and have made not just mathematics but all information digital, we are subjecting human discourse},

We assess the impact of newspaper closures on polarized voting, using genetic matching to compare counties that are statistically similar but for the loss of a local newspaper. We identify a small but significant causal decrease in split-ticket voting in presidential and senatorial elections in these matched communities: in areas where a newspaper closed, split-ticket voting decreased by 1.9{\%}},

While such instruments are gaining increasing popularity across the country, their use is attracting tremendous controversy. Much of the controversy concerns potential discriminatory bias in the risk assessments that are produced. This paper discusses several fairness criteria that have recently been applied to assess the fairness of recidivism prediction instruments. We demonstrate that the criteria cannot all be simultaneously satisfied when recidivism prevalence differs across groups. We then show how disparate impact can arise when a recidivism prediction instrument fails to satisfy the criterion of error rate balance.},

Such a taxonomy can serve as an analytic lens for the continued investigation of the role of affect in creative collaborative endeavors as mediated by communication technology.

abstract = {The impact of aggregators on news outlets is ambiguous. In particular, the existing theoretical literature highlights that although aggregators create a market expansion effect when they bring visitors to news outlets, they also generate a substitution effect if some visitors switch from the news outlets to the aggregators. Using the shutdown of the Spanish edition of Google News in December of 2014 and difference-in-differences methodology, this paper empirically examines the relevance of these two effects. We show the shutdown of Google News in Spain decreased the number of daily visits to Spanish news outlets by 14{\%}, and that this effect was larger in outlets with less overall daily visits and a lower share of international visitors. We also find some evidence suggesting that the shutdown decreased online advertisement revenues for larger online news outlets. We then analyze the effect of the opt-in policy adopted by the German edition of Google News in October of 2014. Although such policy did not significantly affect the daily visits of all outlets that opted out, it reduced by 8{\%} the number of visits of the outlets controlled by the publisher Axel Springer. Our results demonstrate the existence of a market-expansion effect through which news aggregators increase consumers' awareness of news outlets' contents, thereby increasing their number of visits.},

abstract = {Most users want their Twitter feed, Facebook page, and YouTube comments to be free of harassment and porn. Whether faced with âfake newsâ or livestreamed violence, âcontent moderatorsâ-who censor or promote user-posted content-have never been more important. This is especially true when the tools that social media platforms use to curb trolling, ban hate speech, and censor pornography can also silence the speech you need to hear. In this revealing and nuanced exploration, award-winning sociologist and cultural observer Tarleton Gillespie provides an overview of current social media practices and explains the underlying rationales for how, when, and why these policies are enforced. In doing so, Gillespie highlights that content moderation receives too little public scrutiny even as it is shapes social norms and creates consequences for public discourse, cultural production, and the fabric of society. Based on interviews with content moderators, creators, and consumers, this accessible, timely book is a must-read for anyone who's ever clicked âlikeâ or âretweet.â. {\textcopyright} 2018 by Tarleton Gillespie.

Examining this interplay, between information intermediaries and those trying to be seen by them, connects the study of algorithmic systems to long-standing concerns about the power of intermediaries â not an algorithmic power, uniquely, but the power to grant visibility and certify meaning, and the challenge of discerning who to grant it to and why. Here, I consider Dan Savage's attempt to redefine the name of U.S. Senator Rick Santorum, a tactical intervention that topped Google's search results for nearly a decade, and then mysteriously dropped during the 2012 Republican nominations.

This failure appears to be related to privacy concerns: the negative effect of combining targeting with obtrusiveness is strongest for people who refuse to give their income and for categories where privacy matters most. Our results suggest a possible explanation for the growing bifurcation in Internet advertising between highly targeted plain text ads and more visually striking but less targeted ads.},

Building on this work, we deploy the learned model in our HighFiveLive mobile application, which detects and classifies symbolic gestures in real-time as they are performed. HighFiveLive is implemented as an Android application with connection to a wrist-worn accelerometer stream (such as a Microsoft Band) as well as a standalone Apple Watch application.},

However, previous work has not considered how people's body impacts the availability and accuracy of GPS positioning and for means to sense such impacts. We present results that the GPS performance degradation on modern smart phones for different hand grip styles and body placements can cause signal strength drops as high as 10-16 dB and double the positioning error. Furthermore, existing phone applications designed to help users identify sources of GPS performance impairment are restricted to show raw signal statistics. To help both users as well as application systems in understanding and mitigating body and environment-induced effects, we propose a method for sensing the current sources of GPS reception impairment in terms of body, urban and indoor conditions. We present results that show that the proposed autonomous method can identify and differentiate such sources, and thus also user environments and phone postures, with reasonable accuracy, while relying solely on GPS receiver data as it is available on most modern smart phones.},

These interests and preferences are then used for selecting ads to present to the user. There is great concern that behavioral advertising in its present form infringes on user privacy. The resulting public debate â which includes consumer advocacy organizations, professional associations, and government agencies â is premised on the notion that OBA and privacy are inherently in conflict. In this paper we propose a practical architecture that enables targeting without compromising user privacy. Behavioral profiling and targeting in our system takes place in the user's browser. We discuss the effectiveness of the system as well as potential social engineering and web-based attacks on the architecture. One complication is billing; ad-networks must bill the correct advertiser without knowing which ad was displayed to the user. We propose an efficient cryptographic billing system that directly solves the problem. We implemented the core targeting system as a Firefox extension and report on its effectiveness.},

In this article, we help to address this gap in the literature by examining how four key principles from human geographyâdistance decay, structured variation in population density, mental maps, and âthe Big Sortâ (spatial homophily)âmanifest in sharing economy platforms. We find that these principles interact with platform design decisions to create systemic biases in which the sharing economy is significantly more effective in dense, high socioeconomic status (SES) areas than in low-SES areas and the suburbs. We further show that these results are robust across two sharing economy platforms: UberX and TaskRabbit. In addition to highlighting systemic sharing economy biases, this article more fundamentally demonstrates the importance of considering well-known geographic principles when designing and studying sharing economy platforms.},

abstract = {In response to the proposition that communication lacks disciplinary status because of deficient core knowledge, I propose that we turn an ostensible weakness into a strength. We should identify our mission as bringing together insights and theories that would otherwise remain scattered in other disciplines. Because of the lack of interchange among the disciplines , hypotheses thoroughly discredited in one field may receive wide acceptance in another. Potential research paradigms remain fractured, with pieces here and there but no comprehensive statement to guide research. By bringing ideas together in one location, communication can aspire to become a master discipline that synthesizes related theories and concepts and exposes them to the most rigorous, comprehensive statement and exploration. Reaching this goal would require a more self-conscious determination by communication scholars to plumb other fields and feed back their studies to outside researchers. At the same time, such an enterprise would enhance the theoretical rigor of communication scholarship proper. The idea of "framing" offers a case study of just the kind of scattered conceptualization I have identified. Despite its omnipresence across the social sciences and humanities, nowhere is there a general statement of framing theory that shows exactly how frames become embedded within and make themselves manifest in a text, or how framing influences thinking. Analysis of this concept suggests how the discipline of communication might contribute something unique: synthesizing a key concept's dis-parate uses, showing how they invariably involve communication, and constructing a coherent theory from them. Whatever its specific use, the concept of framing consistently offers a way to describe the power of a communicating text. Analysis of frames illuminates the precise way in which influence over a human consciousness is exerted by the transfer (or communication) of information from Robert M.

There is an ongoing debate about the value of such tracking and the associated loss of privacy experienced by users. We inform this debate by quantifying the value of using different kinds of potentially privacy-intrusive information in targeted advertising. We find that using increasingly privacy-intrusive information increases the accuracy of prediction of purchases, but at a decreasing rate. We also find that targeted advertising is effective in increasing purchase probability and that this effect increases with the baseline purchase probability of a user. Finally, we simulate different privacy policy regimes by restricting different kinds of user information from being used for targeted advertising and quantify the impact such restrictions have on sales. We find that using privacy-intrusive user information can increase ad effectiveness by over 30{\%} compared to random targeting. Using temporal information such as time spent by a user on an advertiser's website and time period since last visit increase ad effectiveness by over 20{\%}. Other privacy-intrusive information, such as time spent on different types of product pages or number of unique products searched do not increase ad effectiveness significantly.},

Hence we suggest Twitter, used more for interaction, functions as a âchat room'; whilst Facebook, used more for broadcasting messages, can be viewed as functioning like a âshowroom'. As Twitter is often associated with societal elites in the Swedish context, it raises a question about the suitability for a PSB to engage to such a degree on this particular platform.},

In extending the concept of fairness to recommender systems, there is an essential tension between the goals of fairness and those of personalization. However, there are contexts in which equity across recommendation outcomes is a desirable goal. It is also the case that in some applications fairness may be a multisided concept, in which the impacts on multiple groups of individuals must be considered. In this paper, we examine two different cases of fairness-aware recommender systems: consumer-centered and provider-centered. We explore the concept of a balanced neighborhood as a mechanism to preserve personalization in recommendation while enhancing the fairness of recommendation outcomes. We show that a modified version of the Sparse Linear Method (SLIM) can be used to improve the balance of user and item neighborhoods, with the result of achieving greater outcome fairness in real-world datasets with minimal loss in ranking performance.},

abstract = {Although ethnography has become a common approach in HCI research and design, considerable confusion still attends both ethnographic practice and the criteria by which it should be evaluated in HCI. Often, ethnography is seen as an approach to field investigation that can generate requirements for systems development; by that token, the major evaluative criterion for an ethnographic study is the implications it can provide for design. Exploring the nature of ethnographic inquiry, this paper suggests that âimplications for designâ may not be the best metric for evaluation and may, indeed, fail to capture the value of ethnographic investigations.},

abstract = {Twitter is now used to distribute substantive content such as breaking news, increasing the importance of assessing the credibility of tweets. As users increasingly access tweets through search, they have less information on which to base credibility judgments as compared to consuming content from direct social network connections. We present survey results regarding users' perceptions of tweet credibility. We find a disparity between features users consider relevant to credibility assessment and those currently revealed by search engines. We then conducted two experiments in which we systematically manipulated several features of tweets to assess their impact on credibility ratings. We show that users are poor judges of truthfulness based on content alone, and instead are influenced by heuristics such as user name when making credibility assessments. Based on these findings, we discuss strategies tweet authors can use to enhance their credibility with readers (and strategies astute readers should be aware of!). We propose design improvements for displaying social search results so as to better convey credibility.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2015 Joshua A.T. Fairfield {\&} Christoph Engel. Privacy is commonly studied as a private good: my personal data is mine to protect and control, and yours is yours. This conception of privacy misses an important component of the policy problem. An individual who is careless with data exposes not only extensive information about herself, but about others as well. The negative externalities imposed on nonconsenting outsiders by such carelessness can be productively studied in terms of welfare economics. If all relevant individuals maximize private benefit, and expect all other relevant individuals to do the same, neoclassical economic theory predicts that society will achieve a suboptimal level of privacy. This prediction holds even if all individuals cherish privacy with the same intensity. As the theoretical literature would have it, the struggle for privacy is destined to become a tragedy. But according to the experimental public-goods literature, there is hope. Like in real life, people in experiments cooperate in groups at rates well above those predicted by neoclassical theory. Groups can. be aided in their struggle to produce public goods by institutions, such as communication, framing, or sanction. With these institutions, communities can manage public goods without heavy-handed government intervention. Legal scholarship has not fully engaged this problem in these terms. In this Article, we explain why privacy has aspects of a public good, and we draw lessons from both the theoretical and the empirical literature on public goods to inform the policy discourse on privacy.},

@incollection{Johnson2011,
abstract = {In this article Johnson defends the following argument: "Computer systems do not have mental states, and even if they could be construed as having mental states, they do not have intendings to act, which arise from an agent's freedom. On the other hand, computer systems have intentionality, and because of this, they should not be dismissed from the realm of morality in the same way that natural objects are dismissed. Natural objects behave from necessity; computer systems and other artifacts behave from necessity after they are created and deployed, but, unlike natural objects, they are intentionally created and deployed." (p. 195) -- She claims that "computer systems aremoral entities, butnot, alone,moral agents. [...] My claim is that those who argue for the moral agency (or potential moral agency) of computers are right inrecognizing the moral importance of computers, but they gowrong in viewing computer systems as independent, autonomous moral agents. Computer systemshave meaning and signiï¬cance only in relation to human beings; they are components in socio-technical systems. What computer systems are and what they do is intertwined with the social practices and systems of meaning of human beings." [p. 195] -- Johnson makes aninteresting distinctionbetweenARTIFACTSandTECHNOLOGIES: "distinction between artifacts and technology. A common way of thinking about technology â perhaps the layperson's way â is to think that it is physical or material objects. I will use the termartifact to refer to the physical object. Philosophers of technology and recent literature from the ï¬eld ofscience and technology studies(STS) have pointed to the misleading nature of this view of technology.Technology is a combination of artifacts, social practices, social relationships, and systems of knowledge. These combinations are sometimes referred to associo-technical ensemblesorsocio-technical systemsornetworks. Artifacts (the products of human contrivance) do not exist without systems of knowledge, social practices, and human relationships. Artifacts are made, adopted, distributed, used and have meaning only in the context of human social activity." [p. 197, emphasis in the original] -- All of this, of course, applies tocomputers and computer systemsas well. [p. 197] -- "The notions of ââmoral agency'' and ââaction'' and the very idea of morality are deeply rooted in western traditions of moral philosophy. Historically human beings have been understood to be diï¬erent from all other living entities because they are free and have thecapacity to act from their freedom. Human beings can reason about and then choose how they behave. Perhaps the best known and most salient expression of this conception of moral agency is provided byKant. However, the idea that humans act (as opposed to behaving from necessity) is presumed by almost all moral theories. Even utilitarianism presumes that human beings are capable of choosing how to behave." [p. 198] -- Johnson explains her perspective onagency(vs behavior!),moral agency,responsibility, andintentionality: "The idea that an individual is primarilyresponsiblefor his or herintended, voluntary behavioris at the core of most accounts of moral agency. Individuals are not held responsible for behavior they did not intend or for the consequences of intentional behavior that they could not foresee.Intentional behaviorhas a complex of causality that is diï¬erent from that of non-intentional or involuntary behavior.Voluntary, intended behavior (action)is understood to beoutward behavior that is caused by a particular kind of internal states, namely, mental states. The internal, mental states cause outward behavior, and because of this, the behavior is amenable to a reason explanation as well as a causal explanation. All behavior (human and non-human; voluntary and involuntary) can be explained by its causes, but only action can be explained by a set of internal mental states. We explain why an agent acted by referring to their beliefs, desires, and other intentional states." [p. 198] -- She continues by describingFIVE REQUIREMENTSfor behaviors to be labeled as 'actions': "Contemporary action theory typically speciï¬es thatfor human behavior to be considered action(and as such appropriate for moral evaluation), it must meet the following conditions. First,there is an agent with an internal state. The internal state consists of desires, beliefs, and other intentional states. These are mental states, andone of these is, necessarily, an intending to act. Together, the intentional states (e.g., a belief that a certain act is possible, a desire to act, plus an intending to act) constitute a reason for acting. Second,there is an outward, embodied eventâ the agent does something, moves his or her body in some way. Third,the internal state is the causeof the outward event; that is, the movement of the body is rationally directed at some state of the world. Fourth, theoutward behavior(the result of rational direction)has an outward eï¬ect. Fifth and ï¬nally, theeï¬ect has to be on a patientâ a recipient of an action, a recipient that can be harmed or helped." [p. 198] -- Johnson analyzes the application of these requirements oncomputer systems, as it has been conducted by researchers in the field. She shows thatconditions 2-5can be met by computers[p. 199], On conditions 4 and 5 (behavior has to have an effect, and the effect has to affect a moral patient), she writes: "...when computer systems behave, their behavior has eï¬ects on other parts of the embodied world, and those embodied eï¬ects can harm or helpmoral patients. The eï¬ectmay be morally neutralsuch as when a computer system produces a moderate change in the temperature in a room or performs a mathematical calculation. However,computer behavior can also produce eï¬ects that harm or help a moral patient, e.g., the image produced on a screen is oï¬ensive, a signal turns oï¬a life support machine, a virus is delivered and implanted in an individual's computer." [p. 199] -- However, Johnson claims,computers do not meet the first requirementâ they lackmental statesthat are required as acausefor outward behavior, if we are to label it as 'action' [p. 199]. -- Computers can displaynon-deterministic behaviors, Johnson says, for instance through the use ofneural networks. She writes: "When computers are programmed to learn, they learn to behave in ways that are well beyond the comprehension of their programmers and well beyond what is given to them as input.Neural networksare proï¬ered as examples of non-deterministic computer systems. At least some computer behavior may be said to be constituted by a mixture of deterministic and non-deterministic elements, as is human behavior." [p. 200] However, she argues thatwe cannot know whether computers' non-deterministic behavior will be anything like that of human beings. [??? This I don't understand...] The argument she seems to want to make is that human beings have mental states and know what that is like, but if comptuters were to have 'mental states', we wouldn't know what they would be like (the Thomas Nagel 'what is it like to be a bat?' argument?).However, we also do not know what it is like for other people to have mental states, or even whether they truly have them, right?! -- To make matters even more complicated, Johnson then goes on to argue that computerslack intendings to act, but do have intentionality... By this she means that they have "the intentionality put into them by the intentional acts of their designers." [p. 201]... It turns out that Johnson it heading for a very traditional perspective of morality/agency: She emphasizes "...thedependence of computer system behavior on human behavior, and especially the intentionality of human behavior. While computer behavior is often inde- pendent in time and place from the designers and users of the computer system,computer systems are always human-made and their eï¬cacy is always created and deployed by the intentionality of human beings." [p. 202] -- She works towards herconclusion, writing: "When computer systems behave, there is atriad of intentionalityat work, the intentionality of thecomputer system designer, the intentionality of thesystem, and the intentionality of theuser. Any one of the components of this triad can be the focal point for moral analysis; that is, we can examine the inten- tionality and behavior of the artifact designer, the intentionality and behavior of the computer system, and the intentionality and behavior of the human user." [p. 202] -- She concludes that "...computer systems cannot by themselves be moral agents, butthey can be components of moral agency. Computer systems (and other artifacts) can bepart of the moral agency of humansinsofar as they provide eï¬cacy to human moral agents and insofar as they can be the result of human moral agency. In this sense, computer systems can be moral entities but not alone moral agents. The intentionality and eï¬cacy of computer systems make many human actions possible and make others easier and therefore more likely to be performed. The designers of such systems have designed this intentionality and eï¬cacy into them; users, then, make use of the intentionality and eï¬cacy through their intentionality and eï¬cacy."

abstract = {To make readers pay for news content has always been a fundamental way to generate revenues for the press and an essential part of its business model. However, the arrival of the internet in the mid-1990s changed this business logic for many newspapers, as they delivered their content on the internet for free, waiting for a return based almost exclusively on advertising revenues. For more than a decade, most publishers adopted the new logic of gratis online news for readers. But this started to change, especially after the 2008 financial crisis. This article analyses the history of this change in the business strategy of the press, reflecting the introduction of different payment systems, and finally paywalls, to generate revenues for online newspapers. The study distinguishes four stages in the evolution of journalistic paywalls and points out the interest in considering the process of paywall adoption as a retro-innovation.

abstract = {General Terms The growing accessibility of mobile devices has substantially reformed the way users access information. While the reactive search by query remains as common as before, recent years have witnessed the emergence of various proactive systems such as Google Now and Microsoft Cortana. In these systems, relevant content is presented to users based on their context without a query. Interestingly, despite the increasing popularity of such services, there is very little known about how users interact with them. In this paper, we present the first study on user interactions with information cards. We demonstrate that the usage patterns of these cards vary depending on time and location. We also show that while overall different topics are clicked by users on proactive and reactive platforms, the topics of the clicked documents by the same user tend to be consistent cross-platform. Furthermore, we propose a supervised framework for re-ranking proactive cards based on the user's context and past history. To train our models, we use the viewport duration and clicks to infer pseudo-relevance labels for the cards. Our results suggest that the quality of card ranking can be significantly improved particularly when the user's reactive search history is matched against the proactive data about the cards.},

The goal of News Recommender Systems (NRS) is to make reading suggestions to users in a personalized way.

In this work, we review the state-of-the-art of designing and evaluating news recommender systems over the last ten years.

abstract = {This article addresses the question of whether personal surveillance on the world wide web is different in nature and intensity from that in the offline world. The article presents a profile of the ways in which privacy problems were framed and addressed in the 1970s and 1990s. Based on an analysis of privacy news stories from 1999â2000, it then presents a typology of the kinds of surveillance practices that have emerged as a result of Internet communications. Five practices are discussed and illustrated: surveillance by glitch, surveillance by default, surveillance by design, surveillance by possession, and surveillance by subject. The article offers some tentative conclusions about the progressive latency of tracking devices, about the complexity created by multi-sourcing, about the robustness of clickstream data, and about the erosion of the distinction between the monitor and the monitored. These trends emphasize the need to reject analysis that frames our understanding of Internet surveillance in terms of its âimpactâ on society. Rather the Internet should be regarded as a âform of lifeâ whose evolving structure becomes embedded in human consciousness and social practice, and whose architecture embodies an inherent valence that is gradually shifting away from the assumptions of anonymity upon which the Internet was originally designed.},

We use HTTP traces consisting of millions of users to aid our study and also present the first comparative study between aggregators. We develop a simple model that captures the various parameters of today's advertising revenues, whose values are estimated via the traces. Our results show that per aggregator revenue is skewed (5{\%} accounting for 90{\%} of revenues), while the contribution of users to advertising revenue is much less skewed (20{\%} accounting for 80{\%} of revenue). Google is dominant in terms of revenue and reach (presence on 80{\%} of publishers). We also show that if all 5{\%} of the top users in terms of revenue were to install pri- vacy protection, with no corresponding reaction from the publishers, then the revenue can drop by 30{\%}.},

In an effort to preserve community value and ensure long- term success, we propose and evaluate a honeypot-based approach for uncovering social spammers in online social systems. Two of the key components of the proposed approach are: (1) The deploy- ment of social honeypots for harvesting deceptive spam profiles from social networking communities; and (2) Statistical analysis of the properties of these spam profiles for creating spam classifiers to actively filter out existing and new spammers. We describe the conceptual framework and design considerations of the proposed approach, and we present concrete observations from the deploy- ment of social honeypots in MySpace and Twitter. We find that the deployed social honeypots identify social spammers with low false positive rates and that the harvested spam data contains signals that are strongly correlated with observable profile features (e.g., content, friend information, posting patterns, etc.). Based on these profile features, we develop machine learning based classifiers for identifying previously unknown spammers with high precision and a low rate of false positives. Categories},

abstract = {This study seeks to provide an initial understanding of the effect of behaviorally targeted advertising on advertising rates and revenues. A survey of twelve ad networks was conducted to obtain quarterly data on pricing (CPM data), conversion rates, and revenues across various types of ad segments (run of network advertising and behavioral advertising). The survey results reveal three key findings: (1) Advertising rates are significantly higher for behaviorally targeted ads. The average CPM for behaviorally targeted advertising is just over twice the average CPM for run-of-network advertising. On average across participating networks, the price of behaviorally targeted advertising in 2009 was 2.68 times the price of run of network advertising. (2) Advertising using behavioral targeting is more successful than standard run of network advertising, creating greater utility for consumers from more relevant advertisements and clear appeal for advertisers from increased ad conversion. (3) Finally, a majority of network advertising revenue is spent acquiring inventory from publishers, making behavioral targeting an important source of revenue for online content and services providers as well as third party ad networks. This study was sponsored by the Network Advertising Initiative (NAI). The NAI is a coalition of more than 40 leading online marketing companies committed to building consumer awareness and reinforcing responsible business and data management practices and standards.

abstract = {We study consumer privacy choice in the context of online display advertising, where advertisers track consumers' browsing to improve ad targeting. In 2010, the American ad industry implemented a self-regulation mechanism that overlaid âAdChoicesâ icons on ads, which consumers could click to opt out of online behavioral advertising. We examine the real-world uptake of AdChoices using transaction data from an ad exchange. Though consumers express strong privacy concerns in surveys, we find that only 0.23{\%} of American ad impressions arise from users who opted out of online behavioral advertising. We also find that opt-out user ads fetch 59.2{\%} less revenue on the exchange than do comparable ads for users who allow behavioral targeting. These findings are broadly consistent with evidence from the European Union and Canada, where industry subsequently implemented the AdChoices program. We calculate an upper bound for the industry's value of the average opt-out user's browsing information to be {\$}8 per capita annually in the US. We find that opt-out users tend to be more technologically sophisticated, though opt-out rates are higher in American states with lower income. These results inform the privacy policy discussion by illuminating the real-world consequences of an opt-out privacy mechanism.},

abstract = {Web search is an integral part of our daily lives. Recently, there has been a trend of personalization in Web search, where different users receive different results for the same search query. The increasing level of personalization is leading to concerns about Filter Bubble effects, where certain users are simply unable to access information that the search engines' algorithm decides is irrelevant. Despite these concerns, there has been little quantification of the extent of personalization in Web search today, or the user attributes that cause it. In light of this situation, we make three contributions. First, we develop a methodology for measuring personalization in Web search results. While conceptually simple, there are numerous details that our methodology must handle in order to accurately attribute differences in search results to personalization. Second, we apply our methodology to 200 users on Google Web Search and 100 users on Bing. We find that, on average, 11.7{\%} of results show differences due to personalization on Google, while 15.8{\%} of results are personalized on Bing, but that this varies widely by search query and by result ranking. Third, we investigate the user features used to personalize on Google Web Search and Bing. Surprisingly, we only find measurable personalization as a result of searching with a logged in account and the IP address of the searching user. Our results are a first step towards understanding the extent and effects of personalization on Web search engines today.},

The troll space isn't the only space worth interrogating, however. During this same period, there was a marked overlap between subcultural trolling and the nebulous, discursive category known colloquially as âinternet culture.â Both were swiftly absorbed into broader popular culture. Both were characterized by overwhelming irony and detached, fetishized laughter. That participants in these early internet culture spaces (which included but were not limited to âclassicâ subcultural trolling) were overwhelmingly white, middle class, and felt comfortable enough in their subject positions to respond to the world with a blanket âlolâ speaks to much deeper problems than the obvious problems. Pressingly, the things that wereâand that for some people, still areâfun and funny and apparently harmless online need more careful unpacking. Fun and funny and apparently harmless things have a way of obscuring weapons that privileged people cannot see, because they do not have to see them. They also have a way of establishing precedent and a step-by-step media manipulation guide that is easily hijacked by those looking to do harm, whose actions often fly under the radarâbecause those actions look familiar, because they look like the things that used to be fun.},

We examine the relationship between the numbers of supporting and challenging items in a collection of political opinion items and readers' satisfaction, and then evaluate whether simple presentation techniques such as highlighting agreeable items or showing them first can increase satisfaction when fewer agreeable items are present. We find individual differences: some people are diversity-seeking while others are challenge-averse. For challenge-averse readers, highlighting appears to make satisfaction with sets of mostly agreeable items more extreme, but does not increase satisfaction overall, and sorting agreeable content first appears to decrease satisfaction rather than increasing it. These findings have important implications for builders of websites that aggregate content reflecting different positions.},

Geotagged tweets and other forms of social media volunteered geographic information (VGI) are becoming increasingly critical to many applications and scientific studies. An important assumption underlying much of this research is that social media VGI is "local", or that its geotags correspond closely with the general home locations of its contributors. We demonstrate through a study on three separate social media communities (Twitter, Flickr, Swarm) that this localness assumption holds in only about 75{\%} of cases. In addition, we show that the geographic contours of localness follow important sociodemographic trends, with social media in, for instance, rural areas and older areas, being substantially less local in character (when controlling for other demographics). We demonstrate through a case study that failure to account for non-local social media VGI can lead to misrepresentative results in social media VGI-based studies. Finally, we compare the methods for determining localness, finding substantial disagreement in certain cases, and highlight new best practices for social media VGI-based studies and systems.},

However, the rise of social media forces a re-examination of this expectation. Using the 8.8-earthquake of February 27, 2010 in Chile as a case study, this article compares which topics were covered by professional journal-ists on broadcast news and Twitter, analyzing both cross-sectional and long-itudinal trends. A positive, reinforcing influence was found among the journalistic agendas of TV and Twitter. However, counter to the idea that social media are echo chambers of traditional media, it was found that Twitter influ-ences TV news more so than the other way around. Thus, the study provides an early lens into the agenda setting function of social media among television news professionals, and its findings are consistent with Twitter succeeding among journalists due to its provision of valuable information. In less than a decade, Twitter has become an important tool for journalists around the world. Surveys show that a majority of news professionals now employ Twitter on a daily basis, although mostly to consumeânot to produceâinformation (Cision, 2015; Gulyas, 2013; Hedman {\&} Djerf-Pierre, 2013). The popularity of Twitter for journalism has spawned a growing literature on how journalists use the platform and its impact on professional norms and routines (e.g., Broersma {\&} Graham, 2013; Sebasti{\'{a}}n Valenzuela(Ph.D., University of Texas at Austin) is an associate professor in the School of Communications at Pontificia Universidad Cat{\'{o}}lica de Chile and associate researcher at the National Research Center for Integrated Natural Disaster Management (CIGIDEN).

However, unlike other open marketplaces (e.g., AirBnB), Uber is a black-box: they do not provide data about supply or demand, and prices are set dynamically by an opaque "surge pricing" algorithm. The lack of transparency has led to concerns about whether Uber artificially manipulate prices, and whether dynamic prices are fair to customers and drivers. In order to understand the impact of surge pricing on passengers and drivers, we present the first in-depth investigation of Uber. We gathered four weeks of data from Uber by emulating 43 copies of the Uber smartphone app and distributing them throughout downtown San Francisco (SF) and midtown Manhattan. Using our dataset, we are able to characterize the dynamics of Uber in SF and Manhattan, as well as identify key implementation details of Uber's surge price algorithm. Our observations about Uber's surge price algorithm raise important questions about the fairness and transparency of this system.},

abstract = {Current smartphone platforms provide ways for users to control access to information about their location. For instance, on the iPhone, when an application requests access to location information, the operating system asks the user whether to grant location access to this application. In this paper, we study how users are using these controls. Do iPhone users allow applications to access their location? Do their decisions differ from application to application? Can we predict how a user will respond for a particular application, given their past responses for other applications? We gather data from iPhone users that sheds new light on these questions. Our results indicate that there are different classes of users: some deny all applications access to their location, some allow all applications access to their location , and some selectively permit a fraction of their applications to access their location. We also find that apps can be separated into different classes by what fraction of users trust the app with their location data. Finally, we investigate using machine learning techniques to predict users' location-sharing decisions; we find that we are sometimes able to predict the user's actual choice, though there is considerable room for improvement. If it is possible to improve the accuracy rate further, this information could be used to relieve users of the cognitive burden of individually assigning location permissions for each application, allowing users to focus their attention on more critical matters.},

In this paper, we conduct the first head-to-head study of 50 popular, free online services to understand which is better for privacy-Web or app? We conduct manual tests, extract personally identifiable information (PII) shared over plain-text and encrypted connections, and analyze the data to understand differences in user-data collection across platforms for the same service. While we find that all platforms expose users' data, there are still opportunities to significantly limit how much information is shared with other parties by selectively using the app or Web version of a service.},

abstract = {The present research proposed a theory of news habit formation based in the uses and gratifications paradigm and applied it to emerging patterns of news consumption among college students. Five distinctive patterns emerged: hometown newspapers, comedy news, cable news, Internet news, and broadcast news. A sixth consumption pattern included diverse sources specializing in depth news coverage. Surveillance and escapism gratifications were the most consistent predictors of news consumption behavior across these patterns. However, habit strength was the most powerful predictor of news consumption overall. Consumption of depth and hometown newspaper sources were related to current events knowledge.

abstract = {Although politicians, scholars and campaigners claim that social media such as Facebook and Twitter profoundly change election campaigns, still little is known about the place of social media in the overall campaign mix and its use compared to traditional campaigning channels like the mass media. Cluster analysis of a representative survey among the candidates in the 2011 parliamentary election in Denmark shows that the candidates can be divided into three groups with differ- ent campaign mixes: a group which mainly communicates through the traditional mass media, a group which emphasizes social media, and a group which puts low emphasis on media in their campaign. The place of social media in the cam- paign mix of Danish candidates can be explained by access to the mainstream media and incentives for individual candidates. Traditional media remain the most impor- tant communication channel in the Danish campaign, but primarily for candidates who are newsworthy due to their experience and incumbency status. These candi- dates use social media to generate coverage in the traditional mass media. Challen- gers and less experienced candidates are more likely to use social media to compensate for lack of attention from the mainstream media, in particular when they are involved in intra-party competition. It is concluded that social media are integrated into Danish campaign mix according to the incentive structure of the electoral system and the media logic which characterizes modern campaigns.},

abstract = {This articles surveys the existing literature on the methods currently used by web services to track the user online as well as their purposes, implications, and possible user's defenses. A significant majority of reviewed articles and web resources are from years 2012-2014. Privacy seems to be the Achilles' heel of today's web. Web services make continuous efforts to obtain as much information as they can about the things we search, the sites we visit, the people with who we contact, and the products we buy. Tracking is usually performed for commercial purposes. We present 5 main groups of methods used for user tracking, which are based on sessions, client storage, client cache, fingerprinting, or yet other approaches. A special focus is placed on mechanisms that use web caches, operational caches, and fingerprinting, as they are usually very rich in terms of using various creative methodologies. We also show how the users can be identified on the web and associated with their real names, e-mail addresses, phone numbers, or even street addresses. We show why tracking is being used and its possible implications for the users (price discrimination, assessing financial credibility, determining insurance coverage, government surveillance, and identity theft). For each of the tracking methods, we present possible defenses. Apart from describing the methods and tools used for keeping the personal data away from being tracked, we also present several tools that were used for research purposes - their main goal is to discover how and by which entity the users are being tracked on their desktop computers or smartphones, provide this information to the users, and visualize it in an accessible and easy to follow way. Finally, we present the currently proposed future approaches to track the user and show that they can potentially pose significant threats to the users' privacy.},

abstract = {Most online service providers offer free services to users and in part, these services collect and monetize personally iden-tifiable information (PII), primarily via targeted advertise-ments. Against this backdrop of economic exploitation of PII, it is vital to understand the value that users put to their own PII. Although studies have tried to discover how users value their privacy, little is known about how users value their PII while browsing, or the exploitation of their PII. Extracting valuations of PII from users is non-trivial â surveys cannot be relied on as they do not gather informa-tion of the context where PII is being released, thus reducing validity of answers. In this work, we rely on refined Experi-ence Sampling â a data collection method that probes users to valuate their PII at the time and place where it was gen-erated in order to minimize retrospective recall and hence increase measurement validity. For obtaining an honest val-uation of PII, we use a reverse second price auction. We developed a web browser plugin and had 168 users â living in Spain â install and use this plugin for 2 weeks in order to extract valuations of PII in different contexts. We found that users value items of their online browsing history for about e 7 (â¼ 10 USD), and they give higher val-uations to their offline PII, such as age and address (about e 25 or â¼ 36 USD). When it comes to PII shared in specific online services, users value information pertaining to finan-cial transactions and social network interactions more than activities like search and shopping. No significant distinc-tion was found between valuations of different quantities of PII (e.g. one vs. 10 search keywords), but deviation was found between types of PII (e.g. photos vs. keywords). Fi-nally, the users' preferred goods for exchanging their PII included money and improvements in service, followed by getting more free services and targeted advertisements.

abstract = {A key goal of the fair-ML community is to develop machine-learning based systems that, once introduced into a social context, can achieve social and legal outcomes such as fairness, justice, and due process. Bedrock concepts in computer science-such as abstraction and modular design-are used to define notions of fairness and discrimination, to produce fairness-aware learning algorithms, and to intervene at different stages of a decision-making pipeline to produce "fair" outcomes. In this paper, however, we contend that these concepts render technical interventions ineffective, inaccurate, and sometimes dangerously misguided when they enter the societal context that surrounds decision-making systems. We outline this mismatch with five "traps" that fair-ML work can fall into even as it attempts to be more context-aware in comparison to traditional data science. We draw on studies of sociotechnical systems in Science and Technology Studies to explain why such traps occur and how to avoid them. Finally, we suggest ways in which technical designers can mitigate the traps through a refocusing of design in terms of process rather than solutions, and by drawing abstraction boundaries to include social actors rather than purely technical ones.},

@article{Lipton2018,
abstract = {Collectively, machine learning (ML) researchers are engaged in the creation and dissemination of knowledge about data-driven algorithms. In a given paper, researchers might aspire to any subset of the following goals, among others: to theoretically characterize what is learnable, to obtain understanding through empirically rigorous experiments, or to build a working system that has high predictive accuracy. While determining which knowledge warrants inquiry may be subjective, once the topic is fixed, papers are most valuable to the community when they act in service of the reader, creating foundational knowledge and communicating as clearly as possible. Recent progress in machine learning comes despite frequent departures from these ideals. In this paper, we focus on the following four patterns that appear to us to be trending in ML scholarship: (i) failure to distinguish between explanation and speculation; (ii) failure to identify the sources of empirical gains, e.g., emphasizing unnecessary modifications to neural architectures when gains actually stem from hyper-parameter tuning; (iii) mathiness: the use of mathematics that obfuscates or impresses rather than clarifies, e.g., by confusing technical and non-technical concepts; and (iv) misuse of language, e.g., by choosing terms of art with colloquial connotations or by overloading established technical terms. While the causes behind these patterns are uncertain, possibilities include the rapid expansion of the community, the consequent thinness of the reviewer pool, and the often-misaligned incentives between scholarship and short-term measures of success (e.g., bibliometrics, attention, and entrepreneurial opportunity). While each pattern offers a corresponding remedy (don't do it), we also discuss some speculative suggestions for how the community might combat these trends.},

@article{Madden2017,
abstract = {Among the many dimensions of digital inequality is the unequal distribution of the risks and resources associated with online life. Americans with lower levels of income and education are acutely aware of a range of digital privacy-related harms that could upend their financial, professional, or social wellbeing. And these concerns are often accompanied by low levels of trust in the institutions and companies that these Americans rely on to be responsible stewards of their data. At the same time, there are significant racial disparities when looking at privacy-related concerns; in particular, foreignborn Hispanic adults stand out for both their privacy sensitivites and their desire to learn more about safeguarding their personal information. Yet, many of those who feel most vulnerable to data-related harms also feel as though it would be difficult for them to find the tools and strategies needed to better protect their personal information online. These are among the key findings of a newly-released survey conducted by the Data {\&} Society Research Institute and supported by a grant from the Digital Trust Foundation. The nationally representative survey was fielded in November and December of 2015 among 3,000 American adults, including an oversample of adults with annual household incomes of less than {\$}40,000. The survey provides new insights into the privacy and security experiences of low-socioeconomic status (low-SES) populations and aims to contribute to a deeper understanding of their technology-related behaviors and beliefs. Americans with lower levels of income and education express heightened concerns about their informational and physical privacy and security. Foreign-born Hispanic adults, who already lack many resources, feel exceptionally vulnerable online and offline. Most Americans also express low levels of trust in key institutions that collect and store their personal data. Various low-socioeconomic status groups continue to be disproportionately reliant on mobile devices as their primary source of internet access. At the same time, internet users with low levels of income and education are less likely to use certain privacy-enhancing tools and strategies. Foreign-born Hispanic internet users are among the least likely to use privacy settings, and almost half who use social media automatically share their location in their posts. Members of low-income groups are less likely to report personal data theft, but more likely to be the victim of an online scam that caused them to lose money. Those with the fewest economic and educational resources also face difficulty accessing the tools and strategies that would help them protect their personal information online. Many of the same groups that feel particulalry vulnerable are also more likely to express a strong desire to learn more about privacy- and security-related skills. Parents with lower levels of income and education are less likely to use technical strategies to manage their children's online safety, but they are just as likely to intervene in non-technical ways.},
annote = {We found that not only are low-income Americans more concerned than their wealthier counterparts about losing control over how their information is collected or being used, but they're also more worried about being harassed online or having their financial information stolen.

abstract = {Exploratory search, in which a user investigates complex concepts, is cumbersome with today's search engines. We present a new exploratory search approach that generates interactive visualizations of query concepts using thematic cartography (e.g. choropleth maps, heat maps). We show how the approach can be applied broadly across both geographic and non-geographic contexts through explicit spatialization, a novel method that leverages any figure or diagram - from a periodic table, to a parliamentary seating chart, to a world map - as a spatial search environment. We enable this capability by introducing explanatory semantic relatedness measures. These measures extend frequently-used semantic relatedness measures to not only estimate the degree of relatedness between two concepts, but also generate human-readable explanations for their estimates by mining Wikipedia's text, hyperlinks, and category structure. We implement our approach in a system called Atlasify, evaluate its key components, and present several use cases. {\textcopyright} 2012 ACM.},

The capture and processing of social data unfolds through a process we call data relations, which ensures the ânaturalâ conversion of daily life into a data stream. The result is nothing less than a new social order, based on continuous tracking, and offering unprecedented new opportunities for social discrimination and behavioral influence. We propose that this process is best understood through the history of colonialism. Thus, data relations enact a new form of data colonialism, normalizing the exploitation of human beings through data, just as historic colonialism appropriated territory and resources and ruled subjects for profit.

@inproceedings{Birnholtz2015,
abstract = {People have long sought answers to questions online, typically using either anonymous or pseudonymous forums or social network platforms that primarily use real names. Systems that allow anonymous communication afford freedom to explore identity and discuss taboo topics, but can result in negative disinhibited behavior such as cyberbullying. Identifiable communication systems allows one to reach a known audience and avoid negative disinhibition, but can constrain behavior with concerns about privacy and reputation. One persistent design issue is understanding how to leverage the benefits of anonymity without suffering its drawbacks. This paper presents a case study analysis of question asking on Facebook confession boards (FCBs), a tool popular on some college campuses. FCBs present a unique configuration in which members of an offline community (e.g., a university) anonymously submit content to a moderator who posts it to a Facebook page where others in the community can view it and respond. Response is via identifiable Facebook comments and likes. Our results show users asking about taboo and stigmatized topics with local others, and receiving relevant responses with little cyberbullying or negativity.},

abstract = {Users of social media sites like Facebook and Twitter rely on crowdsourced content recommendation systems (e.g., Trending Topics) to retrieve important and useful information. Contents selected for recommendation indirectly give the initial users who promoted (by liking or posting) the content an opportunity to propagate their messages to a wider audience. Hence, it is important to understand the demographics of people who make a content worthy of recommendation, and explore whether they are representative of the media site's overall population. In this work, using extensive data collected from Twitter, we make the first attempt to quantify and explore the demographic biases in the crowdsourced recommendations. Our analysis, focusing on the selection of trending topics, finds that a large fraction of trends are promoted by crowds whose demographics are significantly different from the overall Twitter population. More worryingly, we find that certain demographic groups are systematically under-represented among the promoters of the trending topics. To make the demographic biases in Twitter trends more transparent, we developed and deployed a Web-based service 'Who-Makes-Trends' at twitter-app.mpi-sws.org/who-makes-trends.},

abstract = {When it is ethical and legal to use a sensitive attribute (such as gender or race) in machine learning systems, the question remains how to do so. We show that the naive application of machine learning algorithms using sensitive features leads to an inherent tradeoff in accuracy between groups. We provide a simple and efficient decoupling technique, that can be added on top of any black-box machine learning algorithm, to learn different classifiers for different groups. Transfer learning is used to mitigate the problem of having too little data on any one group. The method can apply to a range of fairness criteria. In particular, we require the application designer to specify as joint loss function that makes explicit the trade-off between fairness and accuracy. Our reduction is shown to efficiently find the minimum loss as long as the objective has a certain natural monotonicity property which may be of independent interest in the study of fairness in algorithms.},

abstract = {The economic imperatives of neoliberalism combined with the technologies of New Public Management have wrought profound changes in the organization of the workplace in many contemporary capitalist societies. Calculative practices including `performance indicators' and `benchmarking' are increasingly being used to measure and reform public sector organizations and improve the productivity and conduct of individuals across a range of professions. These processes have resulted in the development of an increasingly pervasive `audit culture', one that derives its legitimacy from its claims to enhance transparency and accountability. Drawing on examples from the UK, particularly the post-1990s' reform of universities, this article sets out to analyse the origins and spread of that audit culture and to theorize its implications for the construction of academic subjectivities. The questions I ask are: How are these technologies of audit refashioning the working environment and what effects do they have on behaviour (and subjectivity) of academics? What does the analysis of the rise of managerialism tell us about wider historical processes of power and change in our society? And why are academics seemingly so complicit in, and unable to challenge, these audit processes?},

abstract = {Twenty-five large field experiments with major U.S. retailers and brokerages, each reaching millions of customers and collectively representing {\$}2.8 million in advertising expenditure, reveal that measuring the returns to advertising is exceedingly difficult. The median confidence interval on ROI is over 100{\%} wide, the smallest exceeds 50{\%}. Detailed sales data show that, relative to the per capita cost of the advertising, individual-level sales are incredibly volatile; a coefficient of variation of 10 is common. Hence, informative advertising experiments can easily require more than ten million person-weeks, making experiments costly and potentially infeasible for many firms. Despite these unfavorable economics, randomized control trials represent progress by injecting new, unbiased information into the market. The statistically small impact of profitable advertising amid such noise means that selection bias is a crippling concern for widely-employed observational methods. We discuss how these biases and weak informational feedback from experiments fundamentally impact both advertisers and publishers.},

abstract = {As consumers spend more time on their mobile devices at various locations, a focal retailer's natural approach is to target potential customers in close proximity to its own location. Yet focal location targeting may cannibalize profits on infra-marginal sales. This study demonstrates the effectiveness of competitive locational targeting, the practice of promoting to consumers near a competitor's location. The analysis is based on a randomized field experiment in which mobile promotions were sent to customers at three similar locations (competitive, focal, and neutral) in shopping malls. The results show that competitive locational targeting has the potential to take advantage of heightened demand that a focal retailer would not otherwise capture. Competitive locational targeting produced increasing returns to promotional discount depth, indicating the presence of threshold effects. In comparison, targeting a retailer's own location produced decreasing returns to deep discounts, indicating saturation effects and profit cannibalization. These findings are important for marketers, who can use competitive locational targeting to profit from incremental sales while preserving margins on sales to consumers near their own locations. Locational targeting has enormous potential as a competitive weapon that allows a retailer to maintain a presence anywhere â including on a competitor's doorstep.},

abstract = {A policy debate centers around the question whether news aggregators such as Google News decrease or increase traffic to online news sites. One side of the debate, typically espoused by publishers, views aggregators as substitutes for traditional news consumption because aggregators' landing pages provide snippets of news stories and therefore reduce the incentive to click on the linked articles. Defendants of aggrega-tors, on the other hand, view aggregators as complements because they make it easier to discover news and therefore drive traffic to publishers. This debate has received particular attention in the European Union where two countries, Germany and Spain, enacted copyright reforms that allow newspapers to charge aggregators for linking to news snippets. In this paper, we use Spain as a natural experiment because Google News shut down all together in response to the reform in December 2014. We compare the news consumption of a large number of Google News users with a synthetic control group of similar non-Google News users. We find that the shutdown of Google News re-duces overall news consumption by about 20{\%} for treatment users, and it reduces page views on publishers other than Google News by 10{\%}. This decrease is concentrated * The authors acknowledge support from Microsoft Research. We would like to thank seminar participants " which used a different natural experiment (in France) to address a similar question. We are currently updating the analysis for the French natural experiment to be consistent with the analytic approach introduced in this paper, and plan to report the updated results as a supplement to this paper. 1 around small publishers while large publishers do not see significant changes in their overall traffic. We further find that when Google News shuts down, its users are able to replace some but not all of the types of news they previously read. Post-shutdown, they read less breaking news, hard news, and news that is not well covered on their favorite news publishers. These news categories explain most of the overall reduction in news consumption, and shed light on the mechanisms through which aggregators interact with traditional publishers.},

We investigate the conditions in which the best ideas prevail in a stylized model of online social network, where agents have behavioral limitations in managing a heavy flow of information. We measure the relationship between the quality of an idea and its likelihood to become prevalent at the system level. We find that both information overload and limited attention contribute to a degradation in the market's discriminative power. A good tradeoff between discriminative power and diversity of information is possible according to the model. However, calibration with empirical data characterizing information load and finite attention in real social media reveals a weak correlation between quality and popularity of information. In these realistic conditions, the model predicts that low-quality information is just as likely to go viral, providing an interpretation for the high volume of misinformation we observe online.},

Several heuristics are used for attribution in practice; however, there is no formal justification for them and many of these fail even in simple canonical settings. The main contribution in this work is to develop an axiomatic framework for attribution in online advertising. In particular, we consider a Markovian model for the user journey through the conversion funnel, in which ad actions may have disparate impacts at different stages. We propose a novel attribution metric, that we refer to as counterfactual adjusted Shapley value, which inherits the desirable properties of the traditional Shapley value. Furthermore, we establish that this metric coincides with an adjusted "unique-uniform" attribution scheme. This scheme is efficiently computable and implementable and can be interpreted as a correction to the commonly used uniform attribution scheme.},

abstract = {Although people tend to mobilize around local problems and restrict their political involvement at other times, the political communication literature generally has focused on national politics and elections. This is particularly surprising in investigations of political involvement since it is at the community level that people should feel more efficacious. Also, both mass and interpersonal communication should be more significant locally given their importance in strengthening community ties. The study reported here focuses on these relationships in a community context, with a survey of six inner-city neighborhoods and six suburbs classified on status using location and census data. Results point to a much more positive role for the media in community politics. Those most likely to rely on neighborhood newspapers as sources are less disillusioned with government, suggesting that the most "grassroots" of print media are more efficacious in their impact than the other channels. Also, readership of a daily newspaper is particularly strong as a predictor of both community political involvement and faith in community civic involvement. Results of the macro analysis suggest that urban sprawl may have consequences for how media affect political involvement. In the data here, distance from the center city and stratification are closely tied--the further out the community, the higher its status. Results by neighborhood structure indicate media specialization as well as a greater dependence on media versus interpersonal influence in the political arena. Thus, we see that political involvement and attitudes are more strongly related to reading the daily newspaper in the more distant suburbs than in the center city. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

abstract = {This paper begins by problematizing the use of âcommunityâ to define and theorize small commercial media outlets that have geography as their primary characteristicâparticularly hyper local and small traditional newspapers connected to larger media organizations in digital space. We then extend the concept of âgeo-social newsâ to outline âgeo-social journalismâ as a specific form of news work currently grouped under the âcommunity mediaâ umbrella. Geo-social is a concept for exploring how small commercial newspapers change as media technologies evolve. It offers a framework for understanding how these news outlets and audiences connect via the notion of âsense of placeâ. It can also be used as a lens for theorizing their role in social flows and movements and as nodes in the global media network. The practice of âgeo-social journalismâ, meanwhile, has two dimensions. Firstly, journalists must engage with the land (environment/agriculture/industry), populations, histories and cultures of the places they report news. Secondly, it involves connections and understandings of the shifting constellations of global and national systems, issues and relationships of the digital era. Finally, this paper argues that by its very nature, âgeo-social journalismâ eschews theoretical universalizing and instead demands fine-grained analyses of the specific dynamic of each âgeo-socialâ publication, its setting and the practices which shape it and it in turn shapes.

abstract = {Thematic analysis is a poorly demarcated, rarely-acknowledged, yet widely-used qualitative analytic method within psychology. In this paper, we argue that it offers an accessible and theoretically-flexible approach to analysing qualitative data. We outline what thematic analysis is, locating it in relation to other qualitative analytic methods that search for themes or patterns, and in relation to different epistemological and ontological positions. We then provide clear guidelines to those wanting to start thematic analysis, or conduct it in a more deliberate and rigorous way, and consider potential pitfalls in conducting thematic analysis. Finally, we outline the disadvantages and advantages of thematic analysis. We conclude by advocating thematic analysis as a useful and flexible method for qualitative research in and beyond psychology.},

abstract = {Today, many e-commerce websites personalize their content, including Net ix (movie recommendations), Amazon (product suggestions), and Yelp (business reviews). In many cases, personalization provides advantages for users: for example, when a user searches for an ambiguous query such as $\backslash$router," Amazon may be able to suggest the woodworking tool instead of the networking device. However, personalization on e-commerce sites may also be used to the user's disadvantage by manipulating the products shown (price steering) or by customizing the prices of products (price discrimination). Unfortunately, today, we lack the tools and techniques necessary to be able to detect such behavior. In this paper, we make three contributions towards addressing this problem. First, we develop a methodology for accurately measuring when price steering and discrimination occur and implement it for a variety of e-commerce web sites. While it may seem conceptually simple to detect differences between users' results, accurately attributing these di erences to price discrimination and steering requires correctly addressing a number of sources of noise. Second, we use the accounts and cookies of over 300 real-world users to detect price steering and discrimination on 16 popular e-commerce sites. We nd evidence for some form of personalization on nine of these e-commerce sites. Third, we investigate the e ect of user behaviors on personalization. We create fake accounts to simulate di erent user features including web browser/OS choice, owning an account, and history of purchased or viewed products. Overall, we nd numerous instances of price steering and discrimination on a variety of top e-commerce sites.},

abstract = {In this article, the authors compare the practices of discursive production among top U.S. political blogs on the left and right during summer 2008. An examination of the top 155 political blogs reveals significant cross-ideological variations along several dimensions. Notably, the authors find evidence of an association between ideological affiliation and the technologies, institutions, and practices of participation. Blogs on the left adopt different, and more participatory, technical platforms, comprise significantly fewer sole-authored sites, include user blogs, maintain more fluid boundaries between secondary and primary content, include longer narrative and discussion posts, and (among the top half of the blogs in the sample) more often use blogs as platforms for mobilization. The findings suggest that the attenuation of the news producer-consumer dichotomy is more pronounced on the left wing of the political blogosphere than on the right. The practices of the left are more consistent with the prediction that the networked public sphere offers new pathways for discursive participation by a wider array of individuals, whereas the practices of the right suggest that a small group of elites may retain more exclusive agenda-setting authority online. The cross-ideological divergence in the findings illustrates that the Internet can be adopted equally to undermine or to replicate the traditional distinction between the production and consumption of political information. The authors conclude that these findings have significant implications for the study of prosumption and for the mechanisms by which the networked public sphere may or may not alter democratic participation relative to the mass mediated public sphere.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 John Wiley {\&} Sons Ltd As location-enabled technologies are becoming ubiquitous, our location is being shared with an ever-growing number of external services. Issues revolving around location privacyâor geoprivacyâtherefore concern the vast majority of the population, largely without knowing how the underlying technologies work and what can be inferred from an individual's location (especially if recorded over longer periods of time). Research, on the other hand, has largely treated this topic from isolated standpoints, most prominently from the technological and ethical points of view. This article therefore reflects upon the current state of geoprivacy from a broader perspective. It integrates technological, ethical, legal, and educational aspects and clarifies how they interact and shape how we deal with the corresponding technology, both individually and as a society. It does so in the form of a manifesto, consisting of 21 theses that summarize the main arguments made in the article. These theses argue that location information is different from other kinds of personal information and, in combination, show why geoprivacy (and privacy in general) needs to be protected and should not become a mere illusion. The fictional couple of Jane and Tom is used as a running example to illustrate how common it has become to share our location information, and how it can be usedâboth for good and for worse.},

abstract = {The amount of online content to which people in reasonably affluent nations have access is increasing at an astonishing - even alarming - rate. Recent studies show, for example, there were 550 billion pages on the World Wide Web in 2001 and that, by January 2005, 11.5 billion pages of the much larger number of existing pages have been publicly indexed. In 1990, there was an online world, but no websites in it. Traditionally, it has been assumed - at least within mainstream Western philosophy - that information is good in virtue of being information; that is to say, merely having an informative nature is a sufficient condition for its being properly characterized as good. Librarians were the first to see something wrong with the idea that information is essentially good, but they are by no means the last. Psychologists, economists, policy-makers, sociologists, philosophers and ordinary people are all becoming concerned that we have too much information. In particular, they are concerned that we are overloaded with information - something that cannot happen if information is, by its very nature, a primary, intrinsic, or instrumental good. But what is information overload? This essay attempts to provide a philosophical explication of the concept of information overload and is therefore what philosophers call conceptual analysis - a task that, along with normative ethical analysis, is distinctive to Anglo-American style analytic philosophy. The methodology is the traditional one associated with conceptual analysis: to identify the deeper metaphysical implications and presuppositions associated with our ordinary use of the relevant terms, which include the terms information and overload.},

abstract = {As Internet users increasingly rely on social media sites like Facebook and Twitter to receive news, they are faced with a bewildering number of news media choices. For example, thousands of Facebook pages today are registered and categorized as some form of news media outlets. Inferring the bias (or slant) of these media pages poses a difficult challenge for media watchdog organizations that traditionally rely on content analysis. In this paper, we explore a novel scalable methodology to accurately infer the biases of thousands of news sources on social media sites like Facebook and Twitter. Our key idea is to utilize their advertiser interfaces, that offer detailed insights into the demographics of the news source's audience on the social media site. We show that the ideological (liberal or conservative) leaning of a news source can be accurately estimated by the extent to which liberals or conservatives are over-/under-represented among its audience. Additionally, we show how biases in a news source's audience demographics, along the lines of race, gender, age, national identity, and income, can be used to infer more fine-grained biases of the source, such as social vs. economic vs. nationalistic conservatism. Finally, we demonstrate the scalability of our approach by building and publicly deploying a system, called "Media Bias Monitor", which makes the biases in audience demographics for over 20,000 news outlets on Facebook transparent to any Internet user.},

abstract = {Regulators, advocates, and scholars have voiced concern with the possibility that algorithms will mask, produce, or reproduce illegal discrimination, and perpetuate stereotypes. In this paper, we recount experiments reported in the computer science literature finding that the ads shown by Google differ based on the gender set in Google Ad Settings. Male identification resulted in more ads for a career coaching service that promoted high paying jobs. While the gender setting appeared causal in the experiments, the complexity of the advertising ecosystem makes it difficult to assess how it interacts with other components in the large third-party ad network that is Google's DoubleClick. Google provides Ad Settings, which displays inferences Google has made about a user's demographics and interests as well as user contributed data. Users can view and edit these settings at google.com/settings/ads. The Ad Settings profile is used to personalize advertisements. However, the Ad Settings profile is but one element of the advertising ecosystem. It interacts with the demographic and key word selections of advertisersâwhich allow ads explicitly to be targeted to or away from users based on gender, and can differently target men and women due to keywords or other parameters that acts as a proxy for genderâwith the Google controlled optimization algorithm that aims to maximize click-through-rates (CTR) and may explicitly learn and tailor base on gender, or on attributes that align with one gender or the otherâand with the prices other advertisers are willing to pay per impression, as well as their choices about demographics and keywords. Thus while toggling between genders yields different ads, exactly why it does so remains opaque. We document the various ways that an advertising system could yield different ads to men and women. We document the various ways in which advertisers can target ads in the Google platform, and run our own experiments demonstrating the ability to have facially discriminatory advertising practices for employment ads through the Google ad platform. We consider how this may interact with the choices of other advertisers, the bidding for impressions, and Google's effort to maximize return on investment. We then explore the legal questions and policy concerns raised by these results. We explore how this behavior relates to prohibitions against gender discrimination in employment advertising under state and federal civil rights law, as well as the interaction between these statutes and Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, which provides broad protection against liability to interactive computer services for other entities speech. We identify several aspects on the ad serving ecosystem that present challenges for existing legal frameworks, specifically: the lack of upfront visibility into the likely output of adword choices; the inability of individual advertisers to know or control how their choices interact with those of other advertisers to influence the display of advertisements across the sexes; and, the difficult of assigning responsibility or blame in such multi-agent, real-time systems.},

abstract = {The public interest value of news is often viewed through the prism of its relationship to democracy. In this respect news should act as: a source of accurate and plural information for citizens; a watchdog on elites; a mediator and/or representative of communities; and as an advocate of the public in campaigning terms. All of these roles are under pressure in the United Kingdom's commercial local news sector. This has led many to speculate, often without evidence, that the output of a new generation of (mainly online) hyperlocal citizen news producers might (at least partially) play some of these roles. To test this assumption, we completed 34 semi-structured interviews with producers, the largest content analysis to date of UK hyperlocal news content (1941 posts on 313 sites), and the largest ever survey of UK community news practitioners (183 responses). We found that these sites produce a good deal of news about community activities, local politics, civic life and local business. Official news sources get a strong platform, but the public (local citizens, community groups) get more of a say than in much mainstream local news. Although there was little balanced coverage in the traditional sense, many community journalists have developed alternative strategies to foster and inform plural debate around contentious local issues. The majority of hyperlocal news producers cover community campaigns and a significant minority have initiated their own. We also found that critical public-interest investigations are carried out by a (surprisingly) large number of community news producers.},

abstract = {To cope with the immense amount of content on the web, search engines often use complex algorithms to personalize search results for individual users. However, personalization of search results has led to worries about the Filter Bubble Effect, where the personalization algorithm decides that some useful information is irrelevant to the user, and thus prevents them from locating it. In this paper, we propose a novel methodology to explore the impact of location-based personalization on Google Search results. Assessing the relationship between location and personalization is crucial, since users' geolocation can be used as a proxy for other demographic traits, like race, income, educational attainment, and political affiliation. In other words, does location-based personalization trap users in geolocal Filter Bubbles? Using our methodology, we collected 30 days of search results from Google Search in response to 240 different queries. By comparing search results gathered from 59 GPS coordinates around the US at three different granularities (county, state, and national), we are able to observe that differences in search results due to personalization grow as physical distance increases. However these differences are highly dependent on what a user searches for: queries for local establishments receive 4-5 different results per page, while more general terms exhibit essentially no personalization.},

abstract = {Algorithms that favor popular items are used to help us select among many choices, from engaging articles on a social media news feed to songs and books that others have purchased, and from top-raked search engine results to highly-cited scientific papers. The goal of these algorithms is to identify high-quality items such as reliable news, beautiful movies, prestigious information sources, and important discoveries --- in short, high-quality content should rank at the top. Prior work has shown that choosing what is popular may amplify random fluctuations and ultimately lead to sub-optimal rankings. Nonetheless, it is often assumed that recommending what is popular will help high-quality content "bubble up" in practice. Here we identify the conditions in which popularity may be a viable proxy for quality content by studying a simple model of cultural market endowed with an intrinsic notion of quality. A parameter representing the cognitive cost of exploration controls the critical trade-off between quality and popularity. We find a regime of intermediate exploration cost where an optimal balance exists, such that choosing what is popular actually promotes high-quality items to the top. Outside of these limits, however, popularity bias is more likely to hinder quality. These findings clarify the effects of algorithmic popularity bias on quality outcomes, and may inform the design of more principled mechanisms for techno-social cultural markets.},

abstract = {What makes a good recommendation or good list of recommendations? Research into recommender systems has traditionally focused on accuracy, in particular how closely the recommender's predicted ratings are to the users' true ratings. However, it has been recognized that other recommendation qualitiesâsuch as whether the list of recommendations is diverse and whether it contains novel itemsâmay have a significant impact on the overall quality of a recommender system. Consequently, in recent years, the focus of recommender systems research has shifted to include a wider range of " beyond accuracy " objectives. In this article, we present a survey of the most discussed beyond-accuracy objectives in recommender systems research: diversity, serendipity, novelty, and coverage. We review the definitions of these objectives and corresponding metrics found in the literature. We also review works that propose optimization strategies for these beyond-accuracy objectives. Since the majority of works focus on one specific objective, we find that it is not clear how the different objectives relate to each other. Hence, we conduct a set of offline experiments aimed at comparing the performance of different optimiza-tion approaches with a view to seeing how they affect objectives other than the ones they are optimizing. We use a set of state-of-the-art recommendation algorithms optimized for recall along with a number of rerank-ing strategies for optimizing the diversity, novelty, and serendipity of the generated recommendations. For each reranking strategy, we measure the effects on the other beyond-accuracy objectives and demonstrate important insights into the correlations between the discussed objectives. For instance, we find that rating-based diversity is positively correlated with novelty, and we demonstrate the positive influence of novelty on recommendation coverage.

abstract = {After years of speculation, price discrimination in e-commerce driven by the personal information that users leave (involuntarily) online, has started attracting the attention of privacy researchers, regulators, and the press. In our previous work we demonstrated instances of products whose prices varied online depending on the location and the characteristics of perspective online buyers. In an effort to scale up our study we have turned to crowd-sourcing. Using a browser extension we have collected the prices obtained by an initial set of 340 test users as they surf the web for products of their interest. This initial dataset has permitted us to identify a set of online stores where price variation is more pronounced. We have focused on this subset, and performed a systematic crawl of their products and logged the prices obtained from different vantage points and browser configurations. By analyzing this dataset we see that there exist several retailers that return prices for the same product that vary by 10{\%}-30{\%} whereas there also exist isolated cases that may vary up to a multiplicative factor, e.g., x2. To the best of our efforts we could not attribute the observed price gaps to currency, shipping, or taxation differences.},

abstract = {Fault-tolerant distributed algorithms play an important role in many critical/high-availability applications. These algorithms are notori-ously difficult to implement correctly, due to asynchronous com-munication and the occurrence of faults, such as the network drop-ping messages or computers crashing. We introduce PSYNC, a domain specific language based on the Heard-Of model, which views asynchronous faulty systems as syn-chronous ones with an adversarial environment that simulates asyn-chrony and faults by dropping messages. We define a runtime sys-tem for PSYNC that efficiently executes on asynchronous networks. We formalize the relation between the runtime system and PSYNC in terms of observational refinement. The high-level lockstep ab-straction introduced by PSYNC simplifies the design and imple-mentation of fault-tolerant distributed algorithms and enables auto-mated formal verification. We have implemented an embedding of PSYNC in the SCALA programming language with a runtime system for asynchronous networks. We show the applicability of PSYNC by implementing several important fault-tolerant distributed algorithms and we com-pare the implementation of consensus algorithms in PSYNC against implementations in other languages in terms of code size, runtime efficiency, and verification.},

Instead the web versions reproduce the substance of their print editions in a way that relates similarly to readers. Reaching stories online can be a process involving multiple screen jumps and scrolls but only a few stories have added features, such as hyperlinks to additional information, images, or interactive resources. Newspaper stories online differ very little from those printed in the originating newspapers. The internet versions do not usually add to or change the text of the stories, and their presentation is visually meagre, especially compared with print, which has a richer typographical range and presents many more images. The results suggest that print publishers use their internet presence as a low-cost place holder that guards their US market position and erects a barrier to the entry of geographical competitors and ideological alternatives in the US news arena.},

Typically, discoverability is narrowly defined as a problem for content creators to find an audience given an abundance of choice. This view misses the important ways that apps, online stores, streaming services, and other platforms coordinate the experiences of content discovery. In this article, we propose an analytical framework for studying the dynamic and personalized processes of content discovery on platforms. Discoverability is a kind of media power constituted by content discovery platforms that coordinate users, content creators, and software to make content more or less engaging. Our framework highlights three dimensions of this process: the design and management of choice in platform interfaces (surrounds), the pathways users take to find content and the effects those choices have (vectors), and the resulting experiences these elements produce.

This paper examines the effect of multiple recommender systems on different diversity dimensions. To this end, it maps different values that diversity can serve, and a respective set of criteria that characterizes a diverse information offer in this particular conception of diversity. We make use of a data set of simulated article recommendations based on actual content of one of the major Dutch broadsheet newspapers and its users (N=21,973 articles, N=500 users). We find that all of the recommendation logics under study proved to lead to a rather diverse set of recommendations that are on par with human editors and that basing recommendations on user histories can substantially increase topic diversity within a recommendation set.},

They were surprised to learn that browsing history is currently used to tailor advertisements, yet they were aware of contextual targeting. Our results identify mismatches between participants' mental models and current approaches for providing users with notice and choice about OBA. Participants misinterpreted icons intended to notify them about behavioral targeting and expected that they could turn to their browser or antivirus software to control OBA. Participants had strong concerns about data collection, and the majority of participants believed that advertisers collect personally identifiable information. They also misunderstood the role of advertising networks, basing their opinions of an advertising network on that company's non-advertising activities. Participants' attitudes towards OBA were complex and context-dependent. While many participants felt tailored advertising could benefit them, existing notice and choice mechanisms are not effectively reaching users. Copyright is held by the author/owner.},

abstract = {Cell phones are ubiquitous. As of 2017, there were more cell phones than people in the United States. Nearly 70 percent of those were smartphones, with 94 percent of millennials carrying a smart device. 1 Cell phones go nearly everywhere, and users are increasingly dependent on smartphone applications for daily activities, such as texting, email, and location assisted direction services. 2 Cellular technology also allows service providers to collect a wealth of information about a user's whereabouts. 3 Cellular service providers automatically record the location of cell phones at regular intervals, transforming them into personal tracking devices. 4 One court described them as the "easi-est means to gather the most comprehensive data about a person's public-and private-movements." 5 Cell phone location data is collected in such high volume that it offers a nearly inexhaustible source of granular information, including when and where someone goes, with whom, and even for what purpose. 6 This white paper surveys the landscape of government acquisition of location data about cell phone users-from cellular providers' collection of location information to the use of technologies that pinpoint where individuals and cell phones are located. It describes how cell phones operate, how that location information is accrued and disseminated, and the technologies that can be used to establish where a phone is, where it has been, and what other users have been in proximity. The paper then analyzes both the legal and policy landscape: how courts have ruled on these issues, how they can be expected to rule in the future, and how agencies have addressed these issues internally, if at all. It adds to concerns that cell phone-based monitoring could violate the constitutional privacy rights of millions of ordinary Americans-and that people of color are disproportionally affected. Finally, it concludes with a set of recommendations to enhance transparency and accountability around the use of cell phone location data and to ensure constitutional protections for users who are affected.},

To force changes in these practices, there have been growing calls for "data strikes." These new types of collective action would seek to create leverage for the public by starving business-critical models (e.g. recommender systems, ranking algorithms) of much-needed training data. However, little is known about how data strikes would work, let alone how effective they would be. Focusing on the important commercial domain of recommender systems, we simulate data strikes under a wide variety of conditions and explore how they can augment traditional boycotts. Our results suggest that data strikes can be effective and that users have more power in their relationship with technology companies than they do with other companies. However, our results also highlight important trade-offs and challenges that must be considered by potential organizers.

Outperforming traditional news outlets, online news aggregators, such as Yahoo News, Google News, and the Huffington Post, have become major sources of news for American audiences. Facing economic hardships, some news organizations cast blame on news aggregators for stealing their content and audiences. However, the relationship between news aggregators and traditional media outlets on the demand side has not received sufficient scholarly attention. Through a national survey of 1,143 U.S. Internet users, this study integrates the uses and gratifications paradigm and an economic approach to pre- dict aggregator consumption and examine market competition. In terms of consumption, among demographic factors, age and ethnicity are the two major predictors of aggregator use. Among psychological factors, opinion motivations is the only non-predictor of aggregator use, suggesting that users do not seek opinion-driven content when they visit aggregator sites. In terms of competition, this study uncovers non-competitive relationships between three major news aggregators and 13 major TV, print, and social media news outlets. Such findings are at odds with industry sentiment and the proposed model serves as a basis for further theorizing news aggregator consumption.},

abstract = {The 3G iPhone was the first consumer device to provide a seamless integration of three positioning technologies: Assisted GPS (A-GPS), WiFi positioning and cellular network positioning. This study presents an evaluation of the accuracy of locations obtained using these three positioning modes on the 3G iPhone. A-GPS locations were validated using surveyed benchmarks and compared to a traditional low-cost GPS receiver running simultaneously. WiFi and cellular positions for indoor locations were validated using high resolution orthophotography. Results indicate that A-GPS locations obtained using the 3G iPhone are much less accurate than those from regular autonomous GPS units (average median error of 8 m for ten 20-minute field tests) but appear sufficient for most Location Based Services (LBS). WiFi locations using the 3G iPhone are much less accurate (median error of 74 m for 58 observations) and fail to meet the published accuracy specifications. Positional errors in WiFi also reveal erratic spatial patterns resulting from the design of the calibration effort underlying the WiFi positioning system. Cellular positioning using the 3G iPhone is the least accurate positioning method (median error of 600 m for 64 observations), consistent with previous studies. Pros and cons of the three positioning technologies are presented in terms of coverage, accuracy and reliability, followed by a discussion of the implications for LBS using the 3G iPhone and similar mobile devices. {\textcopyright} 2009 Blackwell Journal compilation {\textcopyright} 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

These developments have combined to impoverish the flow of existing revenues available to fund journalism, impact radically on traditional journalism professional practices, while simultaneously generating an increasingly frenzied search for sustainable and equivalent funding -- and from a wide range of sources - to nurture and deliver quality journalism in the future. This book brings together journalists and distinguished academic specialists from around the globe to present the findings from their research and to discuss the future of journalism, the shifting quality of its products, its wide ranging sources of finance, as well as the economic and democratic consequences of the significant changes confronting Journalism. The Future of Journalism details the challenges facing the press in contemporary societies and provides essential reading for everyone interested in the role of journalism in shaping and sustaining literate, civil and democratic societies. This book consists of special issues from Journalism Studies and Journalism Practice.},

abstract = {The Recommender Systems community is paying increasing atten- tion to novelty and diversity as key qualities beyond accuracy in real recommendation scenarios. Despite the raise of interest and work on the topic in recent years, we find that a clear common methodological and conceptual ground for the evaluation of these dimensions is still to be consolidated. Different evaluation metrics have been reported in the literature but the precise relation, distinc- tion or equivalence between them has not been explicitly studied. Furthermore, the metrics reported so far miss important properties such as taking into consideration the ranking of recommended items, or whether items are relevant or not, when assessing the novelty and diversity of recommendations. We present a formal framework for the definition of novelty and diversity metrics that unifies and generalizes several state of the art metrics. We identify three essential ground concepts at the roots of novelty and diversity: choice, discovery and relevance, upon which the framework is built. Item rank and relevance are introduced through a probabilistic recommendation browsing model, building upon the same three basic concepts. Based on the combination of ground elements, and the assumptions of the browsing model, differ- ent metrics and variants unfold. We report experimental observations which validate and illustrate the properties of the proposed metrics.},

abstract = {This paper studies the potential to better understand display advertising response using observational data from real-time bidding (RTB) exchanges. While non-random exposure to display ads creates endogeneity concerns, unique aspects of the RTB ecosystem allow for common sources of selection, targeting and browsing intensity, to be directly observed and measured. Including these measures in a standard advertising response model mitigates the associated biases. In a two-month panel detailing interactions between 29 campaigns and nearly one million users, we estimate that display advertising increased conversion probability by 127{\%} and was positive and significant in 90{\%} of campaigns. When selection controls are omitted, advertising response was overstated by more than five-fold. An advantage of the proposed approach is the ability to readily explore factors moderating response, and the paper concludes by examining two such features: conversion event and device type. By recovering accurate response estimates from available data, the approach allows advertisers to continuously monitor and improve display advertising effectiveness. Further, it provides an incentive aligning structure to mitigate pervasive agency problems between advertisers and ad-serving platforms.},

abstract = {This article explores the governance by algorithms in information societies. Theoretically, it builds on (co-)evolutionary innovation studies in order to adequately grasp the interplay of technological and societal change and combines these with institutional approaches to incorporate governance by technology or rather software as institutions. Methodologically, it draws from an empirical survey of Internet-based services that rely on automated algorithmic selection, a functional typology derived from it, and an analysis of associated potential social risks. It shows how algorithmic selection has become a growing source of social order, of a shared social reality in information societies. It argues that â similar to the construction of realities by traditional mass media â automated algorithmic selection applications shape daily lives and realities, affect the perception of the world, and influence behavior. However, the co-evolutionary perspective on algorithms as institutions, ideologies, intermediaries, and actors highlights differences that are to be found, first, in the growing personalization of constructed realities and, second, in the constellation of involved actors. Altogether, compared to reality construction by traditional mass media, algorithmic reality construction tends to increase individualization, commercialization, inequalities, and deterritorialization and to decrease transparency, controllability, and predictability.},

This paper takes a first principled look at measurement methodologies for ad networks.

abstract = {REPORT: Too often we tend to hear one single narrative about the state of newspapers in the United States. The newspaper industry is not one sector. While there are considerable variances between the myriad of outletsâ whether national titles, major metros, dailies in large towns, alt weeklies, publications in rural communities, ethnic press, and so onâa major challenge for anyone trying to make sense of industry data is its aggregated nature. It's nearly impossible to deduce trends or characteristics at a more granular level. The story of local newspapers with circulations below 50,000, or what we call âsmall-market newspapers,â tends to get overlooked due to the narrative dominance of larger players. However, small-market publications represent a major cohort that we as a community of researchers know very little about, and a community of practitioners that too oftenâwe were toldâknows little about itself. Our study seeks to help redress this recent imbalance. We embarked on our research with a relatively simple yet ambitious research question: How are small-market newspapers responding to digital disruption? From the data collected in our research, we also strove to report on the future of small-market newspapers by asking: How can small-market newspapers best prepare for the future? Our research findings are based on interviews with fifty-three experts from across the publishing industry, academia, and foundations with a strong interest in the local news landscape. So as to make a fair assessment of the topic's placement against a wider news background, we did not limit ourselves just to those with immediate connection to small-market newspapers. From},

By examining the MemeEconomy community on Reddit, where âmeme traders' appropriate stock market terminology to discuss and appraise memes, this article aims to understand how this particular subculture of self-proclaimed meme insiders assigns value to viral media. Our findings point to the salience of four key features that are seen to determine a meme's value: its positioning in relation to the mainstream, its versatility and expansion potential, its topicality or cultural relevance, and its perceived quality. We discuss implications for the formation and reinforcement of subcultural identities around memes, and theorize the role of vernacular criticism as fulfilling significant social functions in online communities.},

abstract = {This article introduces and discusses the role of bespoke code in Wikipedia, which is code that runs alongside a platform or system, rather than being integrated into server-side codebases by individuals with privileged access to the server. Bespoke code complicates the common metaphors of platforms and sovereignty that we typically use to discuss the governance and regulation of software systems through code. Specifically, the work of automated software agents (bots) in the operation and administration of Wikipedia is examined, with a focus on the materiality of code. As bots extend and modify the functionality of sites like Wikipedia, but must be continuously operated on computers that are independent from the servers hosting the site, they involve alternative relations of power and code. Instead of taking for granted the pre-existing stability of Wikipedia as a platform, bots and other bespoke code require that we examine not only the software code itself, but also the concrete, historically contingent material conditions under which this code is run. To this end, this article weaves a series of autobiographical vignettes about the author's experiences as a bot developer alongside more traditional academic discourse. {\textcopyright} 2013 {\textcopyright} 2013 Taylor {\&} Francis.},

abstract = {Twitter, a microblogging service less than three years old, commands more than 41 million users as of July 2009 and is growing fast. Twitter users tweet about any topic within the 140-character limit and follow others to receive their tweets. The goal of this paper is to study the topological characteristics of Twitter and its power as a new medium of information sharing. We have crawled the entire Twitter site and obtained 41.7 million user profiles, 1.47 billion social relations, 4, 262 trending topics, and 106 million tweets. In its follower-following topology analysis we have found a non-power-law follower distribution, a short effective diameter, and low reciprocity, which all mark a deviation from known characteristics of human social networks [28]. In order to identify influentials on Twitter, we have ranked users by the number of followers and by PageRank and found two rankings to be similar. Ranking by retweets differs from the previous two rankings, indicating a gap in influence inferred from the number of followers and that from the popularity of one's tweets. We have analyzed the tweets of top trending topics and reported on their temporal behavior and user participation. We have classified the trending topics based on the active period and the tweets and show that the majority (over 85{\%}) of topics are headline news or persistent news in nature. A closer look at retweets reveals that any retweeted tweet is to reach an average of 1, 000 users no matter what the number of followers is of the original tweet. Once retweeted, a tweet gets retweeted almost instantly on next hops, signifying fast diffusion of information after the 1st retweet. To the best of our knowledge this work is the first quantitative study on the entire Twittersphere and information diffusion on it.},

Recently, the number of likes of a Facebook page has become a measure of its popularity and profitability, and an underground market of services boosting page likes, aka like farms, has emerged. Some reports have suggested that like farms use a network of profiles that also like other pages to elude fraud protection algorithms, however, to the best of our knowledge, there has been no systematic analysis of Facebook pages' promotion methods. This paper presents a comparative measurement study of page likes garnered via Facebook ads and by a few like farms. We deploy a set of honeypot pages, promote them using both methods, and analyze garnered likes based on likers' demographic, temporal, and social characteristics. We highlight a few interesting findings, including that some farms seem to be operated by bots and do not really try to hide the nature of their operations, while others follow a stealthier approach, mimicking regular users' behavior.},

While most production studies focus on the journalistic labour process, based on current empirical research in the UK press and access to key decision-makers, this article presents case studies of the strategies pursued by the Financial Times and The Telegraph in migrating from print to digital. It shows how new conceptions of the news business are being articulated by managements and how production is being reshaped and increasingly driven by data analytics, and poses questions about the impact of these changes on journalistic practices.},

This paper presents the first tool addressing this challenge, the Facebook Data Valuation Tool (FDVT). The FDVT provides Facebook users with a personalized and real-time estimation of the revenue they generate for Face-book. Relying on the FDVT, we are able to shed light into several relevant HCI research questions that require a data valuation tool in place. The obtained results reveal that (i) there exists a deep lack of awareness among Internet users regarding the monetary value of personal information, (ii) data valuation tools such as the FDVT are useful means to reduce such knowledge gap, (iii) 1/3 of the users testing the FDVT show a substantial engagement with the tool.},

abstract = {Behavioral Targeting (BT) is a technique used by online advertisers to increase the effectiveness of their campaigns, and is playing an increasingly important role in the online advertising market. However, it is underexplored in academia how much BT can truly help online advertising in search engines. In this paper we provide an empirical study on the click-through log of advertisements collected from a commercial search engine. From the experiment results over a period of seven days, we draw three important conclusions: (1) Users who clicked the same ad will truly have similar behaviors on the Web; (2) Click-Through Rate (CTR) of an ad can be averagely improved as high as 670{\%} by properly segmenting users for behavioral targeted advertising in a sponsored search; (3) Using short term user behaviors to represent users is more effective than using long term user behaviors for BT. We conducted statistical t-test which verified that all conclusions drawn in the paper are statistically significant. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first empirical study for BT on the click-through log of real world ads.},

Algorithms count votes, approve loan and credit card applications, target citizens or neighborhoods for police scrutiny, select taxpayers for IRS audit, grant or deny immigration visas, and more. The accountability mechanisms and legal standards that govern such decision processes have not kept pace with technology. The tools currently available to policymakers, legislators, and courts were developed to oversee human decisionmakers and often fail when applied to computers instead. For example, how do you judge the intent of a piece of software? Because automated decision systems can return potentially incorrect, unjustified, or unfair results, additional approaches are needed to make such systems accountable and governable. This Article reveals a new technological toolkit to verify that automated decisions comply with key standards of legal fairness. We challenge the dominant position in the legal literature that transparency will solve these problems. Disclosure of source code is often neither necessary (because of alternative techniques from computer science) nor sufficient (because of the issues analyzing code) to demonstrate the fairness of a process.

abstract = {Numerous surveys have shown that Web users are concerned about the loss of privacy associated with online tracking. Alarmingly, these surveys also reveal that people are also unaware of the amount of data sharing that occurs between ad exchanges, and thus underestimate the privacy risks associated with online tracking. In reality, the modern ad ecosystem is fueled by a flow of user data between trackers and ad exchanges. Although recent work has shown that ad exchanges routinely perform cookie matching with other exchanges, these studies are based on brittle heuristics that cannot detect all forms of information sharing, especially under adversarial conditions. In this study, we develop a methodology that is able to detect client-and server-side flows of information between arbitrary ad exchanges. Our key insight is to leverage retargeted ads as a tool for identifying information flows. Intuitively, our methodology works because it relies on the semantics of how exchanges serve ads, rather than focusing on specific cookie matching mechanisms. Using crawled data on 35,448 ad impressions, we show that our methodology can successfully categorize four different kinds of information sharing behavior between ad exchanges, including cases where existing heuristic methods fail. We conclude with a discussion of how our findings and methodologies can be leveraged to give users more control over what kind of ads they see and how their information is shared between ad exchanges.},

Setting the Agenda describes the mass media's significant and sometimes controversial role in determining which topics are at the centre of public attention and action. In this new edition of his comprehensive book, Max McCombs, one of the founding fathers of the agenda-setting tradition of research, extends his previous synthesis of hundreds of studies carried out on this central role of the mass media in the shaping of public opinion. Across the world, the mass media strongly influences how we picture public affairs. In describing this media influence on what we think about and how we think about it, Setting the Agenda also discusses the sources of these media agendas, the psychological explanation for their impact on the public agenda, and the subsequent consequences for attitudes, opinions and behaviour. New to this edition, McCombs debates the role of the expanded media landscape on agenda setting, the impact of the internet on the power of legacy media and the role of agenda setting beyond the realm of public affairs. This fully updated new edition will prove invaluable to students of media, communications and politics, as well as those interested in the role of mass media in shaping and directing public opinion.

Letting the huge debate around privacy aside, a very important question in this area, for which little is known, is: How much do advertisers pay to reach an individual? In this study, we develop a first of its kind methodology for computing exactly that-the price paid for a web user by the ad ecosystem-and we do that in real time. Our approach is based on tapping on the Real Time Bidding (RTB) protocol to collect cleartext and encrypted prices for winning bids paid by advertisers in order to place targeted ads. Our main technical contribution is a method for tallying winning bids even when they are encrypted. We achieve this by training a model using as ground truth prices obtained by running our own "probe" ad-campaigns. We design our methodology through a browser extension and a back-end server that provides it with fresh models for encrypted bids. We validate our methodology using a one year long trace of 1600 mobile users and demonstrate that it can estimate a user's advertising worth with more than 82{\%} accuracy.},

Analysis of suggests that the answer the site Slashdot.org is a qualified yes, but that important challenges remain for designers of such systems. Thousands of users act as moderators. Final scores for comments are reasonably dispersed and the community generally agrees that moderations are fair. On the other hand, much of a conversation can pass before the best and worst comments are identified. Of those moderations that were judged unfair, only about half were subsequently counterbalanced by a moderation in the other direction. And comments with low scores, not at top-level, or posted late in a conversation were more likely to be overlooked by moderators.},

abstract = {We examine the use of "Audio Journaling" as a multi-faceted practice and participatory research method to engage young participants in forms of creative expression, self and peerbased reflection, and participatory assessment. We share our experiences from incorporating this approach in three different participatory media programs conducted with adolescents in Gaza, Jerusalem, and New York City since 2011. In prior work, audio diaries have been used as reflective probes with young adults for conducting social research, and with the visually impaired to elicit rich contextual experiences informing HCI design. Our findings illustrate how audio journaling can be used with adolescents in participatory media programs to capture spontaneous and introspective experience-focused accounts with emotional resonance, while revealing the process of sense-making in a lightweight and unobtrusive manner. We believe these practices can enhance participatory learning, co-creation, and peer-based evaluation of program outcomes.},

Taking a different angle, this paper tries to understand what kind of social role the audience wants their local media to perform. The material presented here relies on audience research and ethnographic investigation of the largest local TV broadcaster in Amsterdam (AT5), as well as on a basic production study of 17 local broadcasters in Rotterdam. It turns out that city residents of Amsterdam expect their local TV station to perform seven social functions: (1) supplying background information (unbiased, reliable, good-humoured, fast and multiperspectival); (2) fostering social integration, or giving citizens insight into how the city "works"; (3) providing inspiration; (4) ensuring representation ("voice", recognition and "mirroring"); (5) increasing local understanding; (6) creating civic memory; and (7) contributing to social cohesion, or a sense of belonging. We argue that local media do not only constitute a precondition for democracy by representing the city to its residents; to meet this standard, local TV broadcasters will also have to become more democratic themselves, in the sense of better representing local residents to the city and each other by supplying more nuanced stories about them. {\textcopyright} 2010 Taylor {\&} Francis.},

The analysis presented is based on a dataset of over 58,000 volunteers who provided their Facebook Likes, detailed demographic profiles, and the results of several psychometric tests. The proposed model uses dimensionality reduction for preprocessing the Likes data, which are then entered into logistic/linear regression to predict individual psychodemographic profiles from Likes. The model correctly discriminates between homosexual and heterosexual men in 88{\%} of cases, African Americans and Caucasian Americans in 95{\%} of cases, and between Democrat and Republican in 85{\%} of cases. For the personality trait "Openness," prediction accuracy is close to the test-retest accuracy of a standard personality test. We give examples of associations between attributes and Likes and discuss implications for online personalization and privacy.},

How do they experience and make sense of these algorithms, given their often hidden and invisible nature? To what extent does an awareness of algorithms affect people's use of these platforms, if at all? To help answer these questions, this article examines people's personal stories about the Facebook algorithm through tweets and interviews with 25 ordinary users. To understand the spaces where people and algorithms meet, this article develops the notion of the algorithmic imaginary. It is argued that the algorithmic imaginary â ways of thinking about what algorithms are, what they should be and how they function â is not just productive of different moods and sensations but plays a generative role in moulding the Facebook algorithm itself. Examining how algorithms make people feel, then, seems crucial if we want to understand their social power.},

Popularity is measured in terms of total playcounts, and the Long Tail model is used in order to rank music artists. Furthermore, metrics derived from complex network analysis are used to detect the influence of the most popular artists in the network of similar artists. The results from the experiments reveal that-as expected by its inherent social component-the collaborative filtering approach is prone to popularity bias. This has some consequences on the discovery ratio as well as in the navigation through the Long Tail. On the other hand, in both audio content-based and human expert-based approaches artists are linked independently of their popularity. This allows one to navigate from a mainstream artist to a Long Tail artist in just two or three clicks.},

abstract = {âTargeted advertising has been subject to many privacy complaints from both users and policy makers. Despite this attention, users still have little understanding of what data the advertising platforms have about them and why they are shown particular ads. To address such concerns, Facebook recently introduced two transparency mechanisms: a " Why am I seeing this? " button that provides users with an explanation of why they were shown a particular ad (ad explanations), and an Ad Preferences Page that provides users with a list of attributes Facebook has inferred about them and how (data explanations). In this paper, we investigate the level of transparency provided by these two mechanisms. We first define a number of key properties of explanations and then evaluate empirically whether Facebook's explanations satisfy them. For our experiments, we develop a browser extension that collects the ads users receive every time they browse Facebook, their respective explanations, and the attributes listed on the Ad Preferences Page; we then use controlled experiments where we create our own ad campaigns and target the users that installed our extension. Our results show that ad explanations are often incomplete and sometimes mis-leading while data explanations are often incomplete and vague. Taken together, our findings have significant implications for users, policy makers, and regulators as social media advertising services mature.},

abstract = {Journalistic judgment is both a central and fraught function of journalism. The privileging of objectivity norms and the externalization of newsworthiness in discourses about journalism leave little room for the legitimation of journalists' subjective judgment. This tension has become more apparent in the digital news era due to the growing use of algorithms in automated news distribution and production. This article argues that algorithmic judgment should be considered distinct from journalists' professional judgment. Algorithmic judgment presents a fundamental challenge to news judgment based on the twin beliefs that human subjectivity is inherently suspect and in need of replacement, while algorithms are inherently objective and in need of implementation. The supplanting of human judgment with algorithmic judgment has significant consequences for both the shape of news and its legitimating discourses.},

Tweets, in contrast, adhered to a consensual pattern of discourse, characterized by heterogeneity of representation and intensive symbolic ideas. The implications of this familiarization of knowledge about science via media communication and the effect of social networks on how we should face future epidemics are considered.},

abstract = {Information providing and gathering increasingly involve technologies like search engines, which actively shape their epistemic surroundings. Yet, a satisfying account of the epistemic responsibilities associated with them does not exist. We analyze automatically generated search suggestions from the perspective of social epistemology to illustrate how epistemic responsibilities associated with a technology can be derived and assigned. Drawing on our previously developed theoretical framework that connects responsible epistemic behavior to practicability, we address two questions: first, given the different technological possibilities available to searchers, the search technology, and search providers, who should bear which responsibilities? Second, given the technology?s epistemically relevant features and potential harms, how should search terms be autocompleted? Our analysis reveals that epistemic responsibility lies mostly with search providers, which should eliminate three categories of autosuggestions: those that result from organized attacks, those that perpetuate damaging stereotypes, and those that associate negative characteristics with specific individuals.},

abstract = {Online advertisements (ads) provide a powerful mechanism for advertisers to effectively target Web users. Ads can be customized based on a user's browsing behavior, geographic location, and personal interests. There is currently a multi-billion dollar market for online advertising, which generates the primary revenue for some of the most popular websites on the Internet. In order to meet the immense market demand, and to manage the complex relationships between advertisers and publishers (i.e., the websites hosting the ads), marketplaces known as "ad exchanges" are employed. These exchanges allow publishers (sellers of ad space) and advertisers(buyers of this ad space) to dynamically broker traffic through ad networks to efficiently maximize profits for all parties. Unfortunately, the complexities of these systems invite a considerable amount of abuse from cybercriminals, who profit at the expense of the advertisers. In this paper, we present a detailed view of how one of the largest ad exchanges operates and the associated security issues from the vantage point of a member ad network. More specifically, we analyzed a dataset containing transactions for ingress and egress ad traffic from this ad network. In addition, we examined information collected from a command-and-control server used to operate a botnet that is leveraged to perpetrate ad fraud against the same ad exchange. {\textcopyright} 2011 ACM.},

abstract = {Do we have a right to transparency when we use content personalization systems? Building on prior work in discrimination detection in data mining, I propose algorithm auditing as a compatible ethical duty for providers of content personalization systems to maintain the transparency of political discourse. I explore barriers to auditing that reveal the practical limitations on the ethical duties of service providers. Content personalization systems can function opaquely and resist auditing. However, the belief that highly complex algorithms, such as bots using machine learning, are incomprehensible to human users should not be an excuse to surrender high quality political discourse. Auditing is recommended as a way to map and redress algorithmic political exclusion in practice. However, the opacity of algorithmic decision making poses a significant challenge to the implementation of auditing. A central ideal of democracy is that political discourse should allow a fair and critical exchange of ideas and values. Political discourse is unavoidably mediated by the mechanisms and technologies citizens use to communicate and to receive information. Personalized content is now delivered to users through modern search engines, social media news feed features, and targeted advertisements (Goldman, 2006; Pariser, 2011). Traditional media channels still broadcast homogenous information to a heterogeneous audience. Content personalization systems display information tailored to individual users, often based on perceived preferences or past behaviors. Content is filtered to fit the user's profile, meaning " the system can predict what will be relevant for the user, filtering out the irrelevant information, increasing relevance and importance to an individual user " (Bozdag, 2013, p. 211). Personalization is accomplished through interactions of (a) prioritization algorithms that decide which topics are (and are not) trending (Bozdag, Brent Mittelstadt: brent.mittelstadt@oii.ow.ac.uk Date submitted: 2016â08â29 1 I gratefully acknowledge the feedback from the day-long workshop Algorithms, Automation and Politics, organized by the European Research Councilâfunded Computational Propaganda project of the Oxford Internet Institute and held as a preconference to the International Communication Association Meeting in Fukuoka, Japan, in June 2016.

We propose 18 generally applicable design guide- lines for human-AI interaction. These guidelines are vali- dated through multiple rounds of evaluation including a user study with 49 design practitioners who tested the guidelines against 20 popular AI-infused products. The results verify the relevance of the guidelines over a spectrum of interaction scenarios and reveal gaps in our knowledge, highlighting op- portunities for further research. Based on the evaluations, we believe the set of design guidelines can serve as a resource to practitioners working on the design of applications and fea- tures that harness AI technologies, and to researchers inter- ested in the further development of guidelines for human-AI interaction},

This study's purpose is to identify and explore the implications for contemporary news stories. Using a content analysis of Belgian election campaign coverage in 2014, we study the role of five newspapers, two daily television newscasts, seven current affairs programmes, radio news bulletins, three news websites, and a selection of Twitter accounts in creating and shaping news stories. We find that the analytical distinction between platforms still matters, since they have different roles in creating and shaping news stories, suggesting that different platform-specific logics are at play. Twitter is an important factor in launching and shaping news stories, but it tends to be dominated by establishment actors (journalists and politicians), whereas citizens only play a modest role.},

Aggregators purchase access to exploit this information when serving ads to a user. Truthfulness and efficiency , attained through an unlimited supply auction, ensure that the interests of all parties in this transaction are aligned. We demonstrate the effectiveness of transactional privacy for web-browsing using a large mobile trace from a major Euro-pean capital.

Some scholars argue that such technological changes increase exposure to diverse perspectives , while others worry they increase ideological segregation. We address the issue by examining web browsing histories for 50,000 U.S.-located users who regularly read online news. We find that social networks and search engines increase the mean ideological distance between individuals. However, somewhat counterintuitively, we also find these same channels increase an individual's exposure to material from his or her less preferred side of the political spectrum. Finally, we show that the vast majority of online news consumption is accounted for by individuals simply visiting the home pages of their favorite, typically mainstream, news outlets, tempering the consequences-both positive and negative-of recent technological changes. We thus uncover evidence for both sides of the debate, while also finding that the magnitude of the eâµects are relatively modest. WORD COUNT: 5,762 words 1},

abstract = {A plurality of experts say digital life will continue to expand people's boundaries and opportunities in the coming decade and produce more help than harm in people's lives. Still, nearly a third think it will be mostly harmful to health, mental fitness and happiness. Most say there are solutions. When the Pew Research Center asks American internet users for their bottom-line judgment about the role of digital technology in their own lives, the vast majority feel it is a good thing. Yet, over the past 18 months a drumbeat of concerns about the personal and societal impact of the internet has been growing-and it crescendoed April 10 and 11, 2018, in the grilling of Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg in Congressional hearings about his company's power and impact on American life. More broadly, the concerns are highlighted by headlines about the "Heavy Toll of 'Always On' Technology," the emergence of a "Techlash" driven by people's disillusionment with the online environment and worries over digital dystopia. Additionally, increasing commentary and research about the effects that people's uses of digital technologies have on their own well-being has been focusing on their level of stress, their likelihood of committing suicide, their ability to perform well at work and in social settings, their capability to focus their attention in an era of information overload, their capacity to modulate their level of connectivity and their general happiness. In light of these mounting concerns, Pew Research Center and Elon University's Imagining the Internet Center queried technology experts, scholars and health specialists on this question: Over the next decade, how will changes in digital life impact people's overall well-being physically and mentally? Some 1,150 experts responded in this non-scientific canvassing. Some 47{\%} of these respondents predict that individuals' well-being will be more helped than harmed by digital life in the next decade, while 32{\%} say people's well-being will be more harmed than helped; and 21{\%} predict there will not be much change in people's well-being from the way it is now. (See the section titled "About this Canvassing of Experts" for further details about this sampling.) Many of those who argue that human well-being will be harmed also acknowledge that digital tools will continue to enhance various aspects of life. They also note there is no turning back. At the same time, hundreds of them suggested interventions in the coming years they feel could mitigate the problems and emphasize the benefits. Moreover, many of the hopeful respondents also agree that some harms will arise in the future, especially to those who are vulnerable. Participants were asked to explain their answers, and most wrote detailed elaborations that provide insights about hopeful and concerning trends. They were allowed to respond anonymously and many did so; their written comments are also included in this report. Three types of themes emerged: those tied to perceived helpfulness to well-being; those tied to potential harms; and those tied to remedies these experts proposed to mitigate foreseeable problems. The themes are outlined in the nearby table. 3},

Here we report results from a randomized controlled trial of political mobilization messages delivered to 61 million Facebook users during the 2010 US congressional elections. The results show that the messages directly influenced political self-expression, information seeking and real-world voting behaviour of millions of people. Furthermore, the messages not only influenced the users who received them but also the users' friends, and friends of friends. The effect of social transmission on real-world voting was greater than the direct effect of the messages themselves, and nearly all the transmission occurred between 'close friends' who were more likely to have a face-to-face relationship. These results suggest that strong ties are instrumental for spreading both online and real-world behaviour in human social networks.},

abstract = {Recent rapid advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning have raised many questions about the regulatory and governance mechanisms for autonomous machines. Many commentators, scholars, and policy-makers now call for ensuring that algorithms governing our lives are transparent, fair, and accountable. Here, I propose a conceptual framework for the regulation of AI and algorithmic systems. I argue that we need tools to program, debug and maintain an algorithmic social contract, a pact between various human stakeholders, mediated by machines. To achieve this, we can adapt the concept of human-in-the-loop (HITL) from the fields of modeling and simulation, and interactive machine learning. In particular, I propose an agenda I call society-in-the-loop (SITL), which combines the HITL control paradigm with mechanisms for negotiating the values of various stakeholders affected by AI systems, and monitoring compliance with the agreement. In short, `SITL = HITL + Social Contract.'},

abstract = {Using survey evidence from the Netherlands, we explore the factors that influence news readers' attitudes toward news personalization. We show that the value of personaliza-tion depends on commonly overlooked factors, such as concerns about a shared news sphere, and the depth and diversity of recommendations. However, these expectations are not universal. Younger, less educated users have little exposure to non-personalized news, and they also show little concern about diverse news recommendations. We discuss the policy implications of our findings. We show that quality news organizations that pursue reader loyalty and trust have a strong incentive to implement personaliza-tion algorithms that help them achieve these particular goals by taking into account diversity expecting user attitudes and providing high quality recommendations. Diversity-valuing news readers are thus well placed to be served by diversity-enhancing recommender algorithms. However, some users are in danger of being left out of this positive feedback loop. We make specific policy suggestions regarding how to address the issue of diversity-reducing feedback loops, and encourage the development of diversity-enhancing ones.},

abstract = {A broad range of research areas including Internet measurement, privacy, and network security rely on lists of target domains to be analysed; researchers make use of target lists for reasons of necessity or efficiency. The popular Alexa list of one million domains is a widely used example. Despite their prevalence in research papers, the soundness of top lists has seldom been questioned by the community: little is known about the lists' creation, representativity, potential biases, stability, or overlap between lists. In this study we survey the extent, nature, and evolution of top lists used by research communities. We assess the structure and stability of these lists, and show that rank manipulation is possible for some lists. We also reproduce the results of several scientific studies to assess the impact of using a top list at all, which list specifically, and the date of list creation. We find that (i) top lists generally overestimate results compared to the general population by a significant margin, often even an order of magnitude, and (ii) some top lists have surprising change characteristics, causing high day-to-day fluctuation and leading to result instability. We conclude our paper with specific recommendations on the use of top lists, and how to interpret results based on top lists with caution.},

@article{Hull2015,
abstract = {The âprivacy paradoxâ refers to the discrepancy between the concern individuals express for their privacy and the apparently low value they actually assign to it when they readily trade personal information for low-value goods online. In this paper, I argue that the privacy paradox masks a more important paradox: the self-management model of privacy embedded in notice-and-consent pages on websites and other, analogous practices can be readily shown to underprotect privacy, even in the economic terms favored by its advocates. The real question, then, is why privacy self-management occupies such a prominent position in privacy law and regulation. Borrowing from Foucault's late writings, I argue that this failure to protect privacy is also a success in ethical subject formation, as it actively pushes privacy norms and practices in a neoliberal direction. In other words, privacy self-management isn't about protecting people's privacy; it's about inculcating the idea that privacy is an individual, commodified good that can be traded for other market goods. Along the way, the self-management regime forces privacy into the market, obstructs the functioning of other, more social, understandings of privacy, and occludes the various ways that individuals attempt to resist adopting the market-based view of themselves and their privacy. Throughout, I use the analytics practices of Facebook and social networking sites as a sustained case study of the point.},

abstract = {Can location-based mobile promotion (LMP) trigger contemporaneous and delayed sales purchases? As mobile technologies can reach users anywhere and anytime, LMP becomes a promising new channel. We unravel the dynamic sales impact of LMP on the basis of a randomized field experiment with 22,000 mobile users sponsored by one of the largest mobile service providers in the world. Our identification strategy is to gauge the marginal increases in consumer purchases of the geo-fenced treatment group of users who received LMP, above and beyond the baseline control groups. There are two controls: one group who received the same LMP but not in the virtual geo-fencing locational range (nongeo-fenced control), and the other who did not receive the LMP but in the geo-fencing range (geo-fenced control). The latter control serves as an organic holdout baseline from the similar population, i.e., counterfactual test of what if without the mobile LMP intervention, to identify the actual "lift" of incremental purchases caused by the treatment with the mobile LMP intervention. Findings suggest that LMP treatment has a significantly stronger impact on contemporaneous (same-day) purchases and delayed (subsequent-days) purchases than the controls. The randomized experiment design renders these findings robust to alternative explanations such as mobile usage behavior heterogeneity, product effects heterogeneity, nonrandomized sample-selection bias, and endogeneity concerns. Follow-up surveys with the field experiment users explore the nuanced mechanisms via which LMP may induce the impulsive, same-day purchases, and create product awareness for the planned subsequent-days purchases. LMP can generate six times more purchases than nongeo-fenced control with the LMP intervention, and 12 times more than geo-fenced control without the LMP intervention. LMP has a delayed sales effect for 12 days after the mobile promotions. The total sales impact of LMP could be underestimated by 54{\%} if excluding the delayed sales impact and only including the contemporaneous impact. These findings are new to the literature and often neglected in mobile promotion practices, proffering novel implications on the sales value of LMP in the mobile era.},

abstract = {We present the first large-scale measurement of smartphone sensor API usage and stateless tracking on the mobile web. We extend the OpenWPM web privacy measurement tool to develop OpenWPM-Mobile, adding the ability to emulate plausible sensor values for different smartphone sensors such as motion, orientation, proximity and light. Using OpenWPM-Mobile we find that one or more sensor APIs are accessed on 3 695 of the top 100K websites by scripts originating from 603 distinct domains. We also detect fingerprinting attempts on mobile platforms, using techniques previously applied in the desktop setting. We find significant overlap between fingerprinting scripts and scripts accessing sensor data. For example, 63{\%} of the scripts that access motion sensors also engage in browser fingerprinting. To better understand the real-world uses of sensor APIs, we cluster JavaScript programs that access device sensors and then perform automated code comparison and manual analysis. We find a significant disparity between the actual and intended use cases of device sensor as drafted by W3C. While some scripts access sensor data to enhance user experience, such as orientation detection and gesture recognition, tracking and analytics are the most common use cases among the scripts we analyzed. We automated the detection of sensor data exfiltration and observed that the raw readings are frequently sent to remote servers for further analysis. Finally, we evaluate available countermeasures against the misuse of sensor APIs. We find that popular tracking protection lists such as EasyList and Disconnect commonly fail to block most tracking scripts that misuse sensors. Studying nine popular mobile browsers we find that even privacy-focused browsers, such as Brave and Firefox Focus, fail to implement mitigations suggested by W3C, which includes limiting sensor access from insecure contexts and cross-origin iframes. We have reported these issues to the browser vendors.},

Factor analysis results showed that content generation using social media was satisfying five socio-psychological needs: showing affection, venting negative feelings, gaining recognition, getting entertainment, and fulfilling cognitive needs. In particular, people who used social media to meet their social needs and their need for affection tended to use Facebook and blogs. In contrast, when users wanted to air out discontent, they often turned to forums. Results also showed that exhibitionists seemed to use social media to show affection, express their negative feelings, and achieve recognition. The study found no generational differences in using Facebook and blogs as a means to satisfy social needs or the need for affection. However, differences in patterns of social media usage were found among Baby Boomers with different narcissistic personalities.

The socio-technical analyses show that LBA in Singapore is technology-ready with government support and industry pull, while conservative advertisers, negative consumer attitudes, and insufficient regulations hinder LBA's diffusion. The results reveal that LBA at an early adopter stage in Singapore has a relatively convergent and competitive value chain, as telcos play a crucial part in creating and distributing LBA services. With a newly launched Personal Data Protection Act, smartphone consumers still show concerns about personal privacy, data security, and intrusive spam. Technical implementation and LBA effectiveness are major inhibitors for advertisers' adoption. The Singapore case offers market and regulatory implications for other mobile-advanced countries to develop mobile marketing, location-based services, and LBA.},

abstract = {ABSTRACTThis paper draws on regulatory governance scholarship to argue that the analytic phenomenon currently known as âBig Data' can be understood as a mode of âdesign-based' regulation. Although Big Data decision-making technologies can take the form of automated decision-making systems, this paper focuses on algorithmic decision-guidance techniques. By highlighting correlations between data items that would not otherwise be observable, these techniques are being used to shape the informational choice context in which individual decision-making occurs, with the aim of channelling attention and decision-making in directions preferred by the âchoice architect'. By relying upon the use of ânudge' â a particular form of choice architecture that alters people's behaviour in a predictable way without forbidding any options or significantly changing their economic incentives, these techniques constitute a âsoft' form of design-based control.

abstract = {In light of the recent emergence of predictive techniques in law enforcement to forecast crimes before they occur, this paper examines the temporal operation of power exercised by predictive policing algorithms. I argue that predictive policing exercises power through a paranoid style that constitutes a form of temporal governmentality. Temporality is especially pertinent to understanding what is ethically at stake in predictive policing as it is continuous with a historical racialized practice of organizing, managing, controlling, and stealing time. After first clarifying the concept of temporal governmentality, I apply this lens to Chicago Police Department's Strategic Subject List. This predictive algorithm operates, I argue, through a para-noid logic that aims to preempt future possibilities of crime on the basis of a criminal past codified in historical crime data.},

Partial least squares results show that privacy concerns have a stronger negative effect on perceived LBA value than perceived sacrifice, while perceived utility, utilisation of contextual information and trust positively predict perceived LBA value. Moreover, perceived LBA value increases consumers' responses to purchase advertised brands, followed by searching for brand information and passing LBA to others.

abstract = {Online publishers and advertisers have recently shown increasing interest in using targeted advertising online. Such targeting allows them to present users with advertisements that are a better match, based on their past browsing and search behavior and other available information (e.g., hobbies registered on a web site). This technique, known as behavioral targeting, has been hailed as the new "Holy Grail" in online advertising because of its potential effectiveness. In this paper, we study the economic implications when an online publisher engages in behavioral targeting. The publisher auctions off an advertising slot and is paid on a cost-per-click basis. Using a horizontal differentiation model to capture the fit between a user and an advertisement being displayed, we identify the factors that affect the publisher's revenue, the advertisers' payoffs, and social welfare. We show that revenue for the online publisher in some circumstances can double when behavioral targeting is used. However, increased revenue for the publisher is not guaranteed: in some cases, the prices of advertising and hence the publisher's revenue can be lower, depending on the degree of competition and the advertisers' valuations. We identify two effects associated with behavioral targeting: a competitive effect and a propensity effect. The relative strength of the two effects determines whether the publisher's revenue is positively or negatively affected. We also demonstrate that, although social welfare is increased and small advertisers are better off under behavioral targeting, the dominant advertiser might be worse off and reluctant to switch from traditional advertising.},

abstract = {Online social networks offer convenient ways to reach out to large audiences. In particular, Facebook pages are increasingly used by businesses, brands, and organizations to connect with multitudes of users worldwide. As the number of likes of a page has become a de-facto measure of its popularity and profitability, an underground market of services artificially inflating page likes ("like farms") has emerged alongside Face-book's official targeted advertising platform. Nonetheless, besides a few media reports, there is little work that systematically analyzes Facebook pages' promotion methods. Aiming to fill this gap, we present a honeypot-based comparative measurement study of page likes garnered via Facebook advertising and from popular like farms. First, we analyze likes based on demographic, temporal, and social characteristics and find that some farms seem to be operated by bots and do not really try to hide the nature of their operations, while others follow a stealthier approach, mimicking regular users' behavior. Next, we look at fraud detection algorithms currently deployed by Facebook and show that they do not work well to detect stealthy farms that spread likes over longer timespans and like popular pages to mimic regular users. To overcome their limitations, we investigate the feasibility of timeline-based detection of like farm accounts, focusing on characterizing content generated by Facebook accounts on their timelines as an indicator of genuine versus fake social activity. We analyze a wide range of features extracted from timeline posts, which we group into two main categories: lexical and non-lexical. We find that like farm accounts tend to re-share content more often, use fewer words and poorer vocabulary, and more often generate duplicate comments and likes compared to normal users. Using relevant lexical and non-lexical features, we build a classifier to detect like farms accounts that achieves a precision higher than 99{\%} and a 93{\%} recall.},

Moreover, the concept has not been clearly differentiated from or systematically related to concepts addressing very similar phenomena - tabloidization and infotainment'.

Against this backdrop, this article offers a conceptual analysis of the concept based on studies in English and other languages. We identify key dimensions of the concept and make suggestions for a standardized definition and multi-dimensional measurement of harder and softer news. In doing so, we propose to distinguish thematic, focus and style features as basic dimensions that - in their combination - make up harder and softer types of news.},

We have taken this line of research one step further and designed a study in which participants were instructed to do lateral reading for credibility assessment by inspecting Google's search engine result page (SERP) of unfamiliar news sources. In this paper, we summarize findings from interviews with 30 participants. A component of the SERP noticed regularly by the participants is the so-called Knowledge Panel, which provides contextual information about the news source being searched. While this is expected, there are other parts of the SERP that participants use to assess the credibility of the source, for example, the freshness of top stories, the panel of recent tweets, or a verified Twitter account. Given the importance attached to the presence of the Knowledge Panel, we discuss how variability in its content affected participants' opinions. Additionally, we perform data collection of the SERP page for a large number of online news sources and compare them. Our results indicate that there are widespread inconsistencies in the coverage and quality of information included in Knowledge Panels.},

Location information indeed is being collected and used by many mobile services to improve revenues, and this gives rise to a heated debate: Privacy advocates ask for stricter regulation on information collection, while companies argue that it would jeopardize the thriving economy of the mobile web. We describe a system that gives users control over their information and does not degrade the data given to aggre-gators. Recognizing that the first challenge is to express locations in a way that is meaningful for advertisers and users, we propose a keyword based design. Keywords characterize locations, let the users inform the system about their sensitivity to disclosure, and build information directly usable by an advertiser's targeting campaign. Our work makes two main contributions: we design a market of location information based on keywords and we analyze its robustness to attacks using data from ad-networks, geo-located services, and cell networks.},

Survey data was collected from 663 college students regarding their use and preference for Facebook, Instagram, or Twitter. Results highlight the popularity of Instagram for college students, and women in particular. Personal characteristics such as gender, age, affordances on specific sites, and privacy concerns predicted social media preference. Expanding upon the privacy paradox, we found that participants who preferred Twitter were more likely to have a public (vs. private) profile, reported higher levels of self-disclosure, and indicated more bridging social capital. Participants who preferred Facebook reported lower levels of self-disclosure, but higher levels of bonding social capital compared to those who preferred Instagram. These findings suggest that associations between privacy settings, disclosure, and social capital vary as a function of both user motivations and the affordances of specific social media sites.},

Abuses of power by Internet platforms have led to calls for âalgorithm transparencyâ and regulation (Pasquale, 2014). This paper responds by asking what an analyst needs to know about algorithms in order to determine if an ICT is acting improperly, unethically or illegally. It further asks whether âthe algorithmâ is a useful object for ethical investigation. The paper briefly reviews the technical history of the term, then performs an ethical analysis of a hypothetical surveillance system to investigate the question of whether it is useful to consider an algorithm âunethicalâ in itself.

abstract = {While computer-mediated communication use and research are proliferating rapidly, findings offer contrasting images regarding the interpersonal character of this technology. Research trends over the history of these media are reviewed with observations across trends suggested so as to provide integrative principles with which to apply media to different circumstances. First, the notion that the media reduce personal influencesâtheir impersonal effectsâis reviewed. Newer theories and research are noted explaining normative âinterpersonalâ uses of the media. From this vantage point, recognizing that impersonal communication is sometimes advantageous, strategies for the intentional depersonalization of media use are inferred, with implications for Group Decision Support Systems effects. Additionally, recognizing that media sometimes facilitate communication that surpasses normal interpersonal levels, a new perspective on âhyperpersonalâ communication is introduced. Subprocesses are discussed pertaining to receivers, senders, channels, and feedback elements in computer-mediated communication that may enhance impressions and interpersonal relations.},

This paper investigates distortions in consumer behavior which may limit the ability of consumers to safeguard their privacy using data from a field experiment at MIT. There are three findings. First, the effect small incentives have on disclosure may explain the privacy paradox: People say they care about privacy, but are willing to relinquish private data to firms quite easily when incentivized to do so. Second, small navigation costs have a tangible effect on how privacy-protective consumers' choices are, often in contrast with stated preferences. Third, the introduction of irrelevant, but reassuring information makes consumers less likely to avoid tracking. We discuss implications for the privacy strategy of firms.},

abstract = {A recent series of experiments demonstrated that introducing ranking bias to election-related search engine results can have a strong and undetectable influence on the preferences of undecided voters. This phenomenon, called the Search Engine Manipulation Effect (SEME), exerts influence largely through order effects that are enhanced in a digital context. We present data from three new experiments involving 3,600 subjects in 39 countries in which we replicate SEME and test design interventions for suppressing the effect. In the replication, voting preferences shifted by 39.0{\%}, a number almost identical to the shift found in a previously published experiment (37.1{\%}). Alerting users to the ranking bias reduced the shift to 22.1{\%}, and more detailed alerts reduced it to 13.8{\%}. Users' browsing behaviors were also significantly altered by the alerts, with more clicks and time going to lower-ranked search results. Although bias alerts were effective in suppressing SEME, we found that SEME could be completely eliminated only by alternating search results â in effect, with an equal-time rule. We propose a browser extension capable of deploying bias alerts in real-time and speculate that SEME might be impacting a wide range of decision-making, not just voting, in which case search engines might need to be strictly regulated.},

abstract = {We perform a field experiment to measure racial discrimination in the labor market. We respond with fictitious resumes to help-wanted ads in Boston and Chicago newspapers. To manipulate perception of race, each resume is randomly assigned either a very African American sounding name or a very White sounding name. The results show significant discrimination against African-American names: White names receive 50 percent more callbacks for interviews. We also find that race affects the benefits of a better resume. For White names, a higher quality resume elicits 30 percent more callbacks whereas for African Americans, it elicits a far smaller increase. Applicants living in better neighborhoods receive more callbacks but, interestingly, this effect does not differ by race. The amount of discrimination is uniform across occupations and industries. Federal contractors and employers who list Equal Opportunity Employer in their ad discriminate as much as other employers. We find little evidence that our results are driven by employers inferring something other than race, such as social class, from the names. These results suggest that racial discrimination is still a prominent feature of the labor market.},

abstract = {Emotional states can be transferred to others via emotional contagion, leading people to experience the same emotions without their awareness. Emotional contagion is well established in laboratory experiments, with people transferring positive and negative emotions to others. Data from a large real-world social network, collected over a 20-y period suggests that longer-lasting moods (e.g., depression, happiness) can be transferred through networks [Fowler JH, Christakis NA (2008) BMJ 337:a2338], although the results are controversial. In an experiment with people who use Facebook, we test whether emotional contagion occurs outside of in-person interaction between individuals by reducing the amount of emotional content in the News Feed. When positive expressions were reduced, people produced fewer positive posts and more negative posts; when negative expressions were reduced, the opposite pattern occurred. These results indicate that emotions expressed by others on Facebook influence our own emotions, constituting experimental evidence for massive-scale contagion via social networks. This work also suggests that, in contrast to prevailing assumptions, in-person interaction and nonverbal cues are not strictly necessary for emotional contagion, and that the observation of others' positive experiences constitutes a positive experience for people.},

We do so through a genealogy of what we call âparticipatory epistemologyâ, defined here as a form of journalistic knowledge in which professional expertise is modified through public interaction. It is our argument that the notion of âcitizen participation in news processâ has not simply functioned as a normative concept but has rather carried with it a particular understanding of what journalists could reasonably know, and how their knowledge could be enhanced by engaging with the public in order to produce journalistic work. By examining four key moments in the evolution of participatory epistemology, as well as the discursive webs that have surrounded these moments, we aim to demonstrate some of the factors which led a cherished and utopian concept to become a dark and dystopian one. In this, we supplement the work of Quandt (2018) and add some historical flesh to the conceptual arguments of his article on âdark participationâ.},

However, these suggestions are not cognitively free: they require users to attend, evaluate, and act upon them. To understand this trade-off between suggestion savings and interaction costs, we conducted a text transcription experiment that controlled interface assertiveness: the tendency for an interface to present itself. Suggestions were either always present (extraverted), never present (introverted), or gated by a probability threshold (ambiverted). Results showed that although increasing the assertiveness of suggestions reduced the number of keyboard actions to enter text and was subjectively preferred, the costs of attending to and using the suggestions impaired average time performance.},

abstract = {Twitter, a microblogging service less than three years old, com- mands more than 41 million users as of July 2009 and is growing fast. Twitter users tweet about any topic within the 140-character limit and follow others to receive their tweets. The goal of this paper is to study the topological characteristics of Twitter and its power as a new medium of information sharing. We have crawled the entire Twitter site and obtained 41.7 million user profiles, 1.47 billion social relations, 4, 262 trending topics, and 106 million tweets. In its follower-following topology analysis we have found a non-power-lawfollower distribution, a short effec- tive diameter, and low reciprocity, which all mark a deviation from known characteristics of human social networks [28]. In order to identify influentials on Twitter, we have ranked users by the number of followers and by PageRank and found two rankings to be sim- ilar. Ranking by retweets differs from the previous two rankings, indicating a gap in influence inferred from the number of followers and that from the popularity of one's tweets. We have analyzed the tweets of top trending topics and reported on their temporal behav- ior and user participation. We have classified the trending topics based on the active period and the tweets and show that the ma- jority (over 85{\%}) of topics are headline news or persistent news in nature. A closer look at retweets reveals that any retweeted tweet is to reach an average of 1, 000 users no matter what the number of followers is of the original tweet. Once retweeted, a tweet gets retweeted almost instantly on next hops, signifying fast diffusion of information after the 1st retweet. To the best of our knowledge this work is the first quantitative study on the entire Twittersphere and information diffusion on it.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016, {\textcopyright} The Author(s) 2016.In recent years, much has been written on âbig data' in both the popular and academic press. After the hubristic declaration of the âend of theory' more nuanced arguments have emerged, suggesting that increasingly pervasive data collection and quantification may have significant implications for the social sciences, even if the social, scientific, political, and economic agendas behind big data are less new than they are often portrayed. Compared to the boosterish tone of much of its press, academic critiques of big data have been relatively muted, often focusing on the continued importance of more traditional forms of domain knowledge and expertise. Indeed, many academic responses to big data enthusiastically celebrate the availability of new data sources and the potential for new insights and perspectives they may enable. Undermining many of these critiques is a lack of attention to the role of technology in society, particularly with respect to the labor process, the continued extension of labor relations into previously private times and places, and the commoditization of more and more aspects of everyday life. In this article, we parse a variety of big data definitions to argue that it is only when individual datums by the million, billion, or more are linked together algorithmically that âbig data' emerges as a commodity. Such decisions do not occur in a vacuum but as part of an asymmetric power relationship in which individuals are dispossessed of the data they generate in their day-to-day lives. We argue that the asymmetry of this data capture process is a means of capitalist âaccumulation by dispossession' that colonizes and commodifies everyday life in ways previously impossible. Situating the promises of âbig data' within the utopian imaginaries of digital frontierism, we suggest processes of data colonialism are actually unfolding behind these utopic promises. Amid private corporate and academic excitement over new forms of data analysis and visualization, situating big data as a form of capitalist expropriation and dispossession stresses the urgent need for critical, theoretical understandings of data and society.},

abstract = {Background: Google AdWords are increasingly used to recruit people into research studies and clinical services. They offer the potential to recruit from targeted control areas in cluster randomized controlled trials (RCTs), but little is known about the feasibility of accurately targeting ads by location and comparing with control areas. Objective: To examine the accuracy and contamination of control areas by a location-targeted online intervention using Google AdWords in a pilot cluster RCT. Methods: Based on previous use of online cognitive behavioral therapy for depression and population size, we purposively selected 16 of the 121 British postcode areas and randomized them to three intervention and one (do-nothing) control arms. Two intervention arms included use of location-targeted AdWords, and we compared these with the do-nothing control arm. We did not raise the visibility of our research website to normal Web searches. Users who clicked on the ad were directed to our project website, which collected the computer Internet protocol (IP) address, date, and time. Visitors were asked for their postcode area and to complete the Patient Health Questionnaire (depression). They were then offered links to several online depression resources. Google Analytics largely uses IP methods to estimate location, but AdWords uses additional information. We compared locations assessed by (1) Analytics, and (2) as self-identified by users. Results: Ads were shown 300,523 times with 4207 click-throughs. There were few site visits except through AdWord click-throughs. Both methods of location assessment agreed there was little contamination of control areas. According to Analytics, 69.75{\%} (2617/3752) of participants were in intervention areas, only 0{\%} (8/3752) in control areas, but 30.04{\%} (1127/3752) in other areas. However, according to user-stated postcodes, only 20.7{\%} (463/2237) were in intervention areas, 1{\%} (22/2236) in control areas, but 78.31{\%} (1751/2236) in other areas. Both location assessments suggested most leakage from the intervention arms was to nearby postcode areas. Analytics data differed from postcodes reported by participants. Analysis of a subset of 200/2236 records over 10 days comparing IP-estimated location with stated postcode suggested that Google AdWords targeted correctly in just half the cases. Analytics agreed with our assessment that, overall, one-third were wrongly targeted by AdWords. There appeared little evidence that people who bothered to give their postcode did not answer truthfully. Conclusions: Although there is likely to be substantial leakage from the targeted areas, if intervention and control areas are a sufficient distance apart, it is feasible to conduct a cluster RCT using online ads to target British postcode areas without significant contamination.

abstract = {Web cookies are used widely by publishers and 3rd parties to track users and their behaviors. Despite the ubiquitous use of cookies, there is little prior work on their characteristics such as standard attributes, placement policies, and the knowledge that can be amassed via 3rd party cookies. In this paper, we present an empirical study of web cookie characteristics, placement practices and information transmission. To conduct this study, we implemented a lightweight web crawler that tracks and stores the cookies as it navigates to websites. We use this crawler to collect over 3.2M cookies from the two crawls, separated by 18 months, of the top 100K Alexa web sites. We report on the general cookie characteristics and add context via a cookie category index and website genre labels. We consider privacy implications by examining specific cookie attributes and placement behavior of 3rd party cookies. We find that 3rd party cookies outnumber 1st party cookies by a factor of two, and we illuminate the connection between domain genres and cookie attributes. We find that less than 1{\%} of the entities that place cookies can aggregate information across 75{\%} of web sites. Finally, we consider the issue of information transmission and aggregation by domains via 3rd party cookies. We develop a mathematical framework to quantify user information leakage for a broad class of users, and present findings using real world domains. In particular, we demonstrate the interplay between a domain's footprint across the Internet and the browsing behavior of users, which has significant impact on information transmission.},

In this paper, we present the results of studies in which we characterize the gender bias present in image search results for a variety of occupations. We experimentally evaluate the effects of bias in image search results on the images people choose to represent those careers and on people's perceptions of the prevalence of men and women in each occupation. We find evidence for both stereotype exaggeration and systematic underrepre- sentation of women in search results. We also find that peo- ple rate search results higher when they are consistent with stereotypes for a career, and shifting the representation of gender in image search results can shift people's percep- tions about real-world distributions.

abstract = {The advent of online advertising has simultaneously created unprecedented opportunities for advertisers to target consumers and prompted privacy concerns among consumers and regulators. This paper estimates the financial impact of privacy policies on the online display ad industry by applying an empirical model to a proprietary auction dataset. Two challenges complicate the analysis. First, while the advertisers are assumed to publicly observe tracking profiles, the econometrician does not see this data. My model overcomes this challenge by disentangling the unobserved premium paid for certain users from the observed bids. In order to simulate a market in which advertisers can no longer track users, I set the unobserved bid premium's variance to zero. Second, the data provider uses a novel auction mechanism in which first-price bidders and second-price bidders operate concurrently. I develop new techniques to analyze these hybrid auctions. I consider three privacy policies that vary by the degree of user choice. My results suggest that online publisher revenues drop by 3.9{\%} under an opt-out policy, 34.6{\%} under an opt-in policy, and 38.5{\%} under a tracking ban. Total advertiser surplus drops by 4.6{\%}, 4'39{\%}, and 45.5{\%} respectively.},

We also explore how different frames become prominent as they compete among media as time passes after shooting events. Finally, we find that key differences emerge between norms of journalistic routine and how users rely on Twitter to express their reactions to these tragic shooting incidents.},

When a user provides a root input, such as a search query, these algorithms dynamically retrieve, curate, and present a list of related inputs, such as search suggestions. Although ubiquitous in online platforms, a lack of research addressing the emphemerality of their outputs and the opacity of their functioning raises concerns of transparency and accountability on where inquiry is steered. Here, we introduce recursive algorithm interrogation (RAI), a breadth-first search method for auditing autocomplete by recursively submitting a root query and its child suggestions to create a network of algorithmic associations. We used RAI to conduct a longitudinal audit of auto-complete on Google and Bing using a focused set of root queries-the names of 38 US governors who were up for reelection-during the summer of 2018. Comparing across search engines, we found a higher turnover rate among longer and lower ranked suggestions on both search engines, a higher prevalence of social media websites in Google's suggestions, a higher prevalence of words classified as a swear or a negative emotion in Bing's suggestions, and periodic shocks that spanned across most of our root queries. We open source our code for conducting RAI and discuss how it could be applied to other platforms, topics, and settings.},

abstract = {Predictive policing systems are increasingly used to determine how to allocate police across a city in order to best prevent crime. Discovered crime data (e.g., arrest counts) are used to help update the model, and the process is repeated. Such systems have been empirically shown to be susceptible to runaway feedback loops, where police are repeatedly sent back to the same neighborhoods regardless of the true crime rate. In response, we develop a mathematical model of predictive policing that proves why this feedback loop occurs, show empirically that this model exhibits such problems, and demonstrate how to change the inputs to a predictive policing system (in a black-box manner) so the runaway feedback loop does not occur, allowing the true crime rate to be learned. Our results are quantitative: we can establish a link (in our model) between the degree to which runaway feedback causes problems and the disparity in crime rates between areas. Moreover, we can also demonstrate the way in which $\backslash$emph{\{}reported{\}} incidents of crime (those reported by residents) and $\backslash$emph{\{}discovered{\}} incidents of crime (i.e. those directly observed by police officers dispatched as a result of the predictive policing algorithm) interact: in brief, while reported incidents can attenuate the degree of runaway feedback, they cannot entirely remove it without the interventions we suggest.},

abstract = {Online advertising platforms such as those of Facebook and Google collect detailed data about users, which they leverage to allow advertisers to target ads to users based on various pieces of user information. While most advertising platforms have transparency mechanisms in place to reveal this collected information to users, these often present an incomplete view of the information being collected and of how it is used for targeting ads, thus necessitating further transparency. In this paper, we describe a novel transparency mechanism that can force transparency upon online advertising platforms: transparency-enhancing advertisements (Treads), which we define as targeted advertisements where the advertiser reveals information about their targeting to the end user. We envision that Treads would allow third-party organizations to act as transparency providers, by allowing users to opt-in and then targeting them with Treads. Through this process, users will have their platform-collected information revealed to them, but the transparency provider will not learn any more information than they would by running a normal ad. We demonstrate the feasibility of Treads by playing the role of a transparency provider: running Facebook ads targeting one of the authors and revealing partner data that Facebook hides from users but provides to advertisers (e.g., net worth). Overall, we believe that Treads can tilt the balance of power back towards users in terms of transparency of advertising platforms, and open promising new avenues for transparency in online advertising.},

I examine three such problems: the embedding of social privilege in datasets as the data is constructed, the differential capabilities of data users (especially differences between citizens and âenterpriseâ users), and the norms that data systems impose through their function as disciplinary systems. In each case I show that open data has the quite real potential to exacerbate rather than alleviate injustices. This necessitates a theory of information justice. I briefly suggest two complementary directions in which such a theory might be developed: one leading toward moral principles that can be used to evaluate the justness of data practices, and another exploring the practices and structures that a social movement promoting information justice might pursue.},

Our study of search engines suggests that they systematically exclude (in some cases by design and in some, accidentally) certain sites and certain types of sites in favor of others, systematically giving prominence to some at the expense of others. We argue that such biases, which would lead to a narrowing of the Web's functioning in society, run counter to the basic architecture of theWeb as well as to the values and ideals that have fueled widespread support for its growth and development. We consider ways of addressing the politics of search engines, raising doubts whether, in particular, the market mechanism could serve as an acceptable corrective.},

The key contributions of the paper include deepening and refocusing the theoretical foundations of crisis communication by experimentally analyzing the effects of traditional and social-media strategies on the recipients' perceptions of reputation; and by analyzing the effects or crisis responses on the recipients' secondary crisis communications (e.g., sharing information and leaving a message) and reactions (e.g., willingness to boycott). The results indicated that the medium matters more than the message. For all three dependent measures - reputation, secondary crisis communication and reactions - main effects of medium occurred, whereas the message had only a significant main effect on secondary crisis reactions. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Directed links in social media could represent anything from intimate friendships to common interests, or even a passion for breaking news or celebrity gossip. Such directed links determine the flow of information and hence indicate a user's influence on others-a concept that is crucial in sociology and viral marketing. In this paper, using a large amount of data collected from Twit-ter, we present an in-depth comparison of three measures of influence: indegree, retweets, and mentions. Based on these measures, we investigate the dynamics of user influence across topics and time. We make several interesting observations. First, popular users who have high indegree are not necessarily influential in terms of spawning retweets or mentions. Second, most influential users can hold significant influence over a variety of topics. Third, influence is not gained spontaneously or accidentally, but through concerted effort such as limiting tweets to a single topic. We believe that these findings provide new insights for viral marketing and suggest that topological measures such as indegree alone reveals very little about the influence of a user.},

How do they come to believe that reasonable people may disagree on any given political controversy? Given that few people talk regularly to those of opposing perspectives, some theorize that mass media, and television in particular, serve as an important source of exposure to the rationales for oppositional views. A series of experimental studies suggests that television does, indeed, have the capacity to encourage greater awareness of oppositional perspectives. However, common characteristics of televised political discourseâand close-up camera perspectivesâcause audiences to view oppositional perspectives as less legitimate than they would have otherwise. I discuss the broader implications of these findings for assessments of the impact of television on the political process, and for the perspective that televised political discourse provides on oppositional political views.},

The notions of multiple homelands and multiple attachments provide a new perspective to study how the community can be imaged and narrated across national borders. It also challenges traditional immigrant scholarship that treats the home country and the host society as an either-or dichotomy for winning immigrants' affection and loyalty.},

Using data on plant-level toxic emissions from 1996 to 2009 from the US Environmental Protection Agency's Toxics Release Inventory, and newly collected data on the location and content of newspapers, I find that the probability that a plant's emissions are featured in a nearby newspaper increases with the plant's proximity to the newspaper's headquarter. Further, plants located near a larger number of newspapers' headquarters produce lower toxic emissions. The latter result is specific to plants operating in those industries that produce consumer goods, suggesting an important role of accountability through consumer demand. An event-study analysis also shows that when newspapers cover the emissions of consumer goods producers, these reduce their emissions by 29{\%} with respect to those plants that were not covered, whereas there is no evidence of differential trends in the years that lead up to coverage.},

Such a shift significantly alters how the category culture has long been practiced, experienced and understood, giving rise to what, following Alexander Galloway, I am calling ?algorithmic culture?. The purpose of this essay is to trace some of the conceptual conditions out of which algorithmic culture has emerged and, in doing so, to offer a preliminary treatment on what it is. In the vein of Raymond Williams? Keywords, I single out three terms whose bearing on the meaning of the word culture seems to have been unusually strong during the period in question: information, crowd and algorithm. My claim is that the offloading of cultural work onto computers, databases and other types of digital technologies has prompted a reshuffling of some of the words most closely associated with culture, giving rise to new senses of the term that may be experientially available but have yet to be well named, documented or recorded. This essay, though largely historical, concludes by connecting the dots critically to the present day. What is at stake in algorithmic culture is the gradual abandonment of culture?s publicness and the emergence of a strange new breed of elite culture purporting to be its opposite.},

Given many hyperlocal producers cite the desire to play a role in producing better communities, this paper breaks new ground in examining the social and cultural dimensions of hyperlocal journalism's news-making, community-building, and place-making roles. We examine this emergent cultural form's affinity with telling stories, and enabling conversations, about civic and political concerns, but also its affinity with, and celebration of, the banal everyday. Employing the novel theoretical concept of reciprocal journalism, we provide new evidence about the mutually reinforcing online, and offline, practices that underpin relationships between producers and the communities they inhabit and represent. Drawing on evidence from the most extensive multi-method study of UK hyperlocal news to date, it demonstrates the different kinds of direct and indirect reciprocal exchange practices common in community news, and shows how such work, often composed of journalistic and community activist practices, can enable and foster relationships of sustained reciprocity which improve and strengthen both hyperlocal news and the communities it serves.},

Creating metadata is challenging not only because one must recognize the artifact; the description must then be encoded into natural language. Language behaviors are influenced by many social factors, particularly when we are asked to describe other people. We consider labels for images of people generated via the ESP Game. While ESP has been shown to produce relevant labels, critics claim they are obvious and stereotypical. Based on theories of linguistic biases, we examine whether there are systematic differences in the ways players describe images of men versus women. Our first analysis considers images of people generally, and reveals a tendency for women to be described with subjective adjectives. A second analysis compares images depicting men and women within each of six occupational roles. Images of women receive more labels related to appearance, whereas those depicting men receive more occupation-related labels. Our work exposes the presence of gender-based stereotypes through linguistic biases, illustrates the forms in which they manifest, and raises important implications for those who design systems or train algorithms using data produced via GWAP.},

Norms can be positive or neg- ative depending on whether they refer to actions that are allowed or disallowed. Our model is expressive enough to capture naturally many notions of privacy found in legisla- tion, including those found in HIPAA, COPPA, and GLBA.

abstract = {An important question that firms face in advertising is developing effective media strategy. Major improvements in the quality of consumer information and the growth of targeted media vehicles allow firms to precisely target advertising to consumer segments within a market. This paper examines advertising strategy when competing firms can target advertising to different groups of consumers within a market. With targeted advertising, we find that firms advertise more to consumers who have a strong preference for their product than to comparison shoppers who can be attracted to the competition. Advertising less to comparison shoppers can be seen as a way for firms to endogenously increase differentiation in the market. In addition, targeting allows the firm to eliminate ?wasted? advertising to consumers whose preferences do not match a product?s attributes. As a result, the targeting of advertising increases equilibrium profits. The model demonstrates how advertising strategies are affected by firms being able to target pricing. Target advertising leads to higher profits, regardless of whether or not the firms have the ability to set targeted prices, and the targeting of advertising can be more valuable for firms in a competitive environment than the ability to target pricing.},

Using a new data set combining pictures of all New York City landlords on Airbnb with their rental prices and information about quality of the rentals, we show that non-black hosts charge approximately 12{\%} more than black hosts for the equivalent rental. These effects are robust when controlling for all information visible in the Airbnb marketplace. These findings highlight the prevalence of discrimination in online marketplaces, suggesting an important unintended consequence of a seemingly-routine mechanism for building trust.},

@book{Pariser,
abstract = {In December 2009, Google began customizing its search results for all users, and we entered a new era of personalization. With little notice or fanfare, our online experience is changing, as the websites we visit are increasingly tailoring themselves to us. In this engaging and visionary book, MoveOn.org board president Eli Pariser lays bare the personalization that is already taking place on every major website, from Facebook to AOL to ABC News. As Pariser reveals, this new trend is nothing short of an invisible revolution in how we consume information, one that will shape how we learn, what we know, and even how our democracy works.The race to collect as much personal data about us as possible, and to tailor our online experience accordingly, is now the defining battle for todays internet giants like Google, Facebook, Apple and Microsoft. Behind the scenes, a burgeoning industry of data companies is tracking our personal information to sell to advertisers, from our political leanings to the hiking boots we just browsed on Zappos.As a result, we will increasingly each live in our own, unique information universewhat Pariser calls the filter bubble. We will receive mainly news that is pleasant, familiar and confirms our beliefsand since these filters are invisible, we wont know what is being hidden from us. Our past interests will determine what we are exposed to in the future, leaving less room for the unexpected encounters that spark creativity, innovation and the democratic exchange of ideas.Drawing on interviews with both cyber-skeptics and cyber-optimists, from the co-founder of OK Cupid, an algorithmically-driven dating website, to one of the chief visionaries of U.S. information warfare, THE FILTER BUBBLE tells the story of how the Internet, a medium built around the open flow ofideas, is closing in on itself under the pressure of commerce and monetization. It peeks behind the curtain at the server farms, algorithms, and geeky entrepreneurs that have given us this new reality, and investigates the consequences of corporate power in the digital age.THE FILTER BUBBLE reveals how personalization could undermine the internets original purpose as an open platform for the spread of ideas, and leave us all in an isolated, echoing world. But it is not too late to change course. Pariser lays out a new vision for the web, one that embraces the benefits of technology without turning a blind eye to its negative consequences, and will ensure that the Internet lives up to its transformative promise.},

We present the results of in-depth interviews and an online survey focusing on participants' views of online advertising and their ability to make decisions about privacy tradeoffs. We find users hold misconceptions about the purpose of cookies and the effects of clearing them. Only 11{\%} of respondents understood the text description of NAI opt-out cookies, which are a self-help mechanism that enables user choice. 86{\%} believe ads are tailored to websites they have visited in the past, but only 39{\%} believe there are currently ads based on email content, and only 9{\%} think it is ok to see ads based on email content as long as their email service is free. About 20{\%} of participants want the benefits of targeted advertising, but 64{\%} find the idea invasive, and we see signs of a possible chilling effect with 40{\%} self-reporting they would change their online behavior if advertisers were collecting data. We find a gap between people's willingness to pay to protect their privacy and their willingness to accept discounts in exchange for private information. 69{\%} believe privacy is a right and 61{\%} think it is "extortion" to pay to keep their data private. Only 11{\%} say they would pay to avoid ads. We find participants are comfortable with the idea that advertising supports free online content, but they do not believe their data are part of that exchange.},

abstract = {We focus here on the digital transition of local and regional newspapers and how they define and navigate the challenges and opportunities they face, including creating digital-first newsrooms, understanding and adapting to audience needs, and diversifying their business models. A key theme is how the approaches of local newspapers' parent companies shape the ways they adapt to digital media. The report is based on 48 interviews with editors, reporters, and commercial directors at newspapers and editorial and commercial executives at their parent companies in the UK, France, Germany, and Finland. Our case newspapers represent both independent and group-owned ownership models. In particular, we suggest that parent companies are pursuing different overall strategies for producing and monetising local news in the digital age. We identify three approaches: the search for national scale, regional breadth, or local depth. These strategies influence not only how local newsrooms make decisions about editorial content but also how they differentiate their online and print products, discuss their audiences, cultivate social media tactics, focus their business models, and develop plans for the future.},

@article{Pielou1966,
abstract = {Information content may be used as a measure of the diversity of a many-species biological collection. The diversity of small collections, all of whose members can be identified and counted, is defined by Brillouin's measure of information. With larger collections it becomes necessary to estimate diversity; what is estimated is Shannon's measure of information which is a function of the population proportions of the several species. Different methods of estimation are appropriate for different types of collections. If the collection can be randomly sampled and the total number of species is known, Basharin's formula may be used. With a random sample from a population containing an unknown number of species, Good's method is sometimes applicable. With a patchy population of sessile organisms, such as a plant community, random samples are unobtainable since the contents of a randomly placed quadrat are not a random sample of the parent population. To estimate the diversity of such a community a method is proposed whereby the sample size is progressively increased by addition of new quadrats; as this is done the diversity of the pooled sample increases and then levels off. The mean increment in total diversity that results from enlarging the sample still more then provides an estimate of the diversity per individual in the whole population. {\textcopyright} 1966.},

abstract = {This article examines how some regional newspapers in Australia are engaging with the social media juggernaut Facebook, and looks at the effects of this on their relationships with audiences in a digital world. We highlight how terms such as 'friend' and 'community' mask complex power struggles taking place across these two media platforms. On the one hand, Facebook can facilitate public conversation and widen the options for journalists to access information; on the other, it has become a competitor as news outlets struggle to find a business model for online spaces. We suggest that newspapers and journalists are facing challenges in navigating the complexities of a platform that crosses public/private domains at a time when the nature of 'private' and 'public' is being contested. The article adopts a 'pooled case comparison' approach, drawing on data from two separate Australian studies that examine regional newspapers in a digital landscape. The research draws on interviews with journalists and editors in Australia across three states, and on focus groups and interviews with newspaper readers in Victoria. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

abstract = {Social media use continues to grow and is especially prevalent among young adults. It is surprising then that, in spite of this enhanced interconnectivity, young adults may be lonelier than other age groups, and that the current generation may be the loneliest ever. We propose that only image-based platforms (e.g., Instagram, Snapchat) have the potential to ameliorate loneliness due to the enhanced intimacy they offer. In contrast, text-based platforms (e.g., Twitter, Yik Yak) offer little intimacy and should have no effect on loneliness. This study (N = 253) uses a mixed-design survey to test this possibility. Quantitative results suggest that loneliness may decrease, while happiness and satisfaction with life may increase, as a function of image-based social media use. In contrast, text-based media use appears ineffectual. Qualitative results suggest that the observed effects may be due to the enhanced intimacy offered by image-based (versus text-based) social media use.},

abstract = {A Google search for a person's name, such as âTrevon Jonesâ, may yield a personalized ad for public records about Trevon that may be neutral, such as âLooking for Trevon Jones? {\ldots}â, or may be suggestive of an arrest record, such as âTrevon Jones, Arrested?...â. This writing investigates the delivery of these kinds of ads by Google AdSense using a sample of racially associated names and finds statistically significant discrimination in ad delivery based on searches of 2184 racially associated personal names across two websites. First names, previously identified by others as being assigned at birth to more black or white babies, are found predictive of race (88{\%} black, 96{\%} white), and those assigned primarily to black babies, such as DeShawn, Darnell and Jermaine, generated ads suggestive of an arrest in 81 to 86 percent of name searches on one website and 92 to 95 percent on the other, while those assigned at birth primarily to whites, such as Geoffrey, Jill and Emma, generated more neutral copy: the word "arrest" appeared in 23 to 29 percent of name searches on one site and 0 to 60 percent on the other. On the more ad trafficked website, a black-identifying name was 25{\%} more likely to get an ad suggestive of an arrest record. A few names did not follow these patterns: Dustin, a name predominantly given to white babies, generated an ad suggestive of arrest 81 and 100 percent of the time. All ads return results for actual individuals and ads appear regardless of whether the name has an arrest record in the company's database. Notwithstanding these findings, the company maintains Google received the same ad text for groups of last names (not first names), raising questions as to whether Google's advertising technology exposes racial bias in society and how ad and search technology can develop to assure racial fairness.},

abstract = {This article summarizes and draws connections among diverse streams of theoretical and empirical research on the economics of privacy. We focus on the economic value and consequences of protecting and disclosing personal information, and on consumers' understanding and decisions regarding the trade-offs associated with the privacy and the sharing of personal data. We highlight how the economic analysis of privacy evolved over time, as advancements in information technology raised increasingly nuanced and complex issues. We find and highlight three themes that connect diverse insights from the literature. First, characterizing a single unifying economic theory of privacy is hard, because privacy issues of economic relevance arise in widely diverse contexts. Second, there are theoretical and empirical situations where the protection of privacy can both enhance and detract from individual and societal welfare. Third, in digital economies, consumers' ability to make informed decisions about their privacy is severely hindered because consumers are often in a position of imperfect or asymmetric information regarding when their data is collected, for what purposes, and with what consequences. We conclude the article by highlighting some of the ongoing issues in the privacy debate of interest to economists. (},

The article considers the changing contexts of information communication, with some caveats about the identification of 'pathologies of information', and analyses the changes over time in the way in which issues of the quantity and quality of information available have been regarded. Two main classes of problems and issues are discussed. The first comprises issues relating to the quantity and diversity of information available: information overload, information anxiety, etc. The second comprises issues relating to the changing information environment with the advent of Web 2.0: loss of identity and authority, emphasis on micro-chunking and shallow novelty, and the impermanence of information. A final section proposes some means of solution of problems and of improvements to the situation.},

Following Donald Trump's inauguration, we recruited 187 participants to complete a survey and install a browser extension that enabled us to collect Search Engine Results Pages (SERPs) from their computers. To quantify partisan audience bias, we developed a domain-level score by leveraging the sharing propensities of registered voters on a large Twitter panel. We found little evidence for the "filter bubble" hypothesis. Instead, we found that results positioned toward the bottom of Google SERPs were more left-leaning than results positioned toward the top, and that the direction and magnitude of overall lean varied by search query, component type (e.g. "answer boxes"), and other factors. Utilizing rank-weighted metrics that we adapted from prior work, we also found that Google's rankings shifted the average lean of SERPs to the right of their unweighted average.},

abstract = {News is one of the earliest application domains of recommender systems, and recommending items from a virtually endless stream of news is still a relevant problem today. News recommendation is different from other application domains in a variety of ways, e.g., because new items constantly become available for recommendation. To be effective, news recommenders therefore have to continuously consider the latest items in the incoming stream of news in their recommendation models. However, today's public software libraries for algorithm benchmarking mostly do not consider these particularities of the domain. As a result, authors often rely on proprietary protocols, which hampers the comparability of the obtained results. In this paper, we present StreamingRec as a framework for evaluating streaming-based news recommenders in a replicable way. The open-source framework implements a replay-based evaluation protocol that allows algorithms to update the underlying models in real-time when new events are recorded and new articles are available for recommendation. Furthermore, a variety of baseline algorithms for session-based recommendation are part of StreamingRec. For these, we also report a number of performance results for two datasets, which confirm the importance of immediate model updates.},

abstract = {The era of ubiquitous computing and big data is now firmly established, with more and more aspects of our everyday lives being mediated, augmented, produced and regulated by digital devices and networked systems powered by software. Software is fundamentally composed of algorithms -- sets of defined steps structured to process instructions/data to produce an output. And yet, to date, there has been little critical reflection on algorithms, nor empirical research into their nature and work. This paper synthesises and extends initial critical thinking about algorithms and considers how best to research them in practice. It makes a case for thinking about algorithms in ways that extend far beyond a technical understanding and approach. It then details four key challenges in conducting research on the specificities of algorithms -- they are often: "black boxed"; heterogeneous, contingent on hundreds of other algorithms, and are embedded in complex socio-technical assemblages; ontogenetic and performative; and "out of control" in their work. Finally, it considers six approaches to empirically research algorithms: examining source code (both deconstructing code and producing genealogies of production); reflexively producing code; reverse engineering; interviewing designers and conducting ethnographies of coding teams; unpacking the wider socio-technical assemblages framing algorithms; and examining how algorithms do work in the world.},

Prior work has documented that users find such targeting simultaneously useful and creepy. We begin unpacking these conflicted feelings through two online studies. In the first study, 306 participants saw one of ten explanations for why they received an ad, reflecting prevalent methods of targeting based on demographics, interests, and other factors. The type of interest-based targeting described in the explanation affected participants' comfort with the targeting and perceptions of its usefulness. We conducted a follow-up study in which 237 participants saw ten interests companies might infer. Both the sensitivity of the interest category and participants' actual interest in that topic significantly impacted their attitudes toward inferencing. Our results inform the design of transparency tools.},

abstract = {Two recent disruptions to the online advertising market are the widespread use of ad-blocking software and proposed restrictions on third-party tracking, trends that are driven largely by consumer concerns over privacy. Both primarily impact display advertising (as opposed to search and native social ads), and affect how retailers reach customers and how content producers earn revenue. It is, however, unclear what the consequences of these trends are. We investigate using anonymized web browsing histories of 14 million individuals, focusing on âretail sessionsâ in which users visit online sites that sell goods and services. We find that only 3{\%} of retail sessions are initiated by display ads, a figure that is robust to permissive attribution rules and consistent across widely varying market segments. We further estimate the full distribution of how retail sessions are initiated, and find that search advertising is three times more important than display advertising to retailers, and search advertising is itself roughly three times less important than organic web search. Moving to content providers, we find that display ads are shown by 12{\%} of websites, accounting for 32{\%} of their page views; this reliance is concentrated in online publishing (e.g., news outlets) where the rate is 91{\%}. While most consumption is either in the long-tail of websites that do not show ads, or sites like Facebook that show native, first-party ads, moderately sized web publishers account for a substantial fraction of consumption, and we argue that they will be most affected by changes in the display advertising market. Finally, we use estimates of ad rates to judge the feasibility of replacing lost ad revenue with a freemium or donation-based model.},

Through a critical analysis of The Echo Nest, a music infomediary whose databases underpin many digital music services, I trace the shift from intermediation to infomediation and explore what is at stake at the intersection of data mining, taste making and audience manufacture.

abstract = {Amid the push for self-driving cars and the roboticization of industrial economies, automation has proven one of the biggest news stories of our time. Yet the wide-scale automation of the news itself has largely escaped attention. In this lively exposeÌ of that rapidly shifting terrain, Nicholas Diakopoulos focuses on the people who tell the stories--increasingly with the help of computer algorithms that are fundamentally changing the creation, dissemination, and reception of the news. Diakopoulos reveals how machine learning and data mining have transformed investigative journalism. Newsbots converse with social media audiences, distributing stories and receiving feedback. Online media has become a platform for A/B testing of content, helping journalists to better understand what moves audiences. Algorithms can even draft certain kinds of stories. These techniques enable media organizations to take advantage of experiments and economies of scale, enhancing the sustainability of the fourth estate. But they also place pressure on editorial decision-making, because they allow journalists to produce more stories, sometimes better ones, but rarely both. Automating the News responds to hype and fears surrounding journalistic algorithms by exploring the human influence embedded in automation. Though the effects of automation are deep, Diakopoulos shows that journalists are at little risk of being displaced. With algorithms at their fingertips, they may work differently and tell different stories than they otherwise would, but their values remain the driving force behind the news. The human-algorithm hybrid thus emerges as the latest embodiment of an age-old tension between commercial imperatives and journalistic principles.-- Introduction: The era of new algorithms -- Hybridization: combining algorithms, automation, and people in news work -- Journalistic data mining -- Automated content production -- News bots: agents of information -- Digital paperboys: algorithms in news distribution -- Algorithmic accountability reporting -- Conclusion: The future of algorithmic news media.},

Fabricated stories in social media, ranging from de-liberate propaganda to hoaxes and satire, contributes to this confusion in addition to having serious effects on global stability. In this work we build predictive models to classify 130 thousand news posts as sus-picious or verified, and predict four sub-types of suspicious news â satire, hoaxes, clickbait and propaganda. We show that neural network models trained on tweet content and social network interactions outperform lexical models. Unlike previ-ous work on deception detection, we find that adding syntax and grammar features to our models does not improve perfor-mance. Incorporating linguistic features improves classification results, however, social interaction features are most in-formative for finer-grained separation be-tween four types of suspicious news posts.},

abstract = {In this work, we investigate whether state-of-the-art object detection systems have equitable pre-dictive performance on pedestrians with different skin tones. This work is motivated by many recent examples of ML and vision systems displaying higher error rates for certain demographic groups than others. We annotate an existing large scale dataset which contains pedestrians, BDD100K, with Fitzpatrick skin tones in ranges [1-3] or [4-6]. We then provide an in depth comparative analysis of performance between these two skin tone groupings, finding that neither time of day nor occlusion explain this behavior, suggesting this disparity is not merely the result of pedestrians in the 4-6 range appearing in more difficult scenes for detection. We investigate to what extent time of day, occlusion, and reweighting the supervised loss during training affect this predictive bias. cd},

abstract = {Mobile devices have hardware and software components that record large amounts of data. Some of the data is apparent to the device owner, some is discarded quickly, and some is hidden from the person using the device. For this study, the researchers used an Android smartphone as a typical user, carrying the device throughout the day, using Facebook and Google applications. Then the smartphone was analyzed using mobile forensic techniques and software. The investigation revealed security and privacy concerns. The researchers were able to retrieve social interactions, pictures, documents, and other personal attributes stored on the device. The most interesting find was location tracking information. This Android phone logged and stored location data when the researcher had location services enabled, but it also continued to collect and store location information after turning location services off. Within Google Maps, the sub-feature called Google Timeline, tracked location, date, and time as long as the phone was powered on. These findings will increase awareness for mobile devices users and may lead to more consumer-centric privacy settings in mobile operating systems.},

These workers face the pervasive and detrimental challenge of wage violations, also known as wage theft, which is any illegal activity by an employer that denies benefits or wages to employees. We interviewed 24 low-wage workers who experienced wage theft and sought justice about their work practices, challenges, and information technology usage. Based on these interviews, we identify three key sociotechnical practices these workers engaged in to address their wage theft: 1) identifying wage and payment discrepancies; 2) tracking and documenting work; and 3) pursuing wage claims. Seeking to leverage HCI research to interrupt uneven social, economic, and information relations in the low-wage workplace, we ultimately reflect on the possibility and limits of several key design recommendations.},

Here, we analyze folk theories of news consumption. On the basis of an inductive analysis of 43 in-depth interviews with infrequent users of conventional news, we identify three complementary folk theories (ânews finds me,ââthe information is out there,â and âI don't know what to believeâ) that consumers draw on when making sense of their information environment. We show that the notion of folk theories help unpack the different, complementary, sometimes contradictory cultural resources people rely on as they navigate digital media and public affairs, and we argue that studying those who rarely engage directly with news media but do access information via social media and search provides a critical case study of the dynamics of an environment increasingly defined by platforms.

The analysis presented is based on a dataset of over 58,000 volunteers who provided their Facebook Likes, detailed demographic profiles, and the results of several psychometric tests. The proposed model uses dimensionality reduction for preprocessing the Likes data, which are then entered into logistic/linear regression to predict individual psychodemographic profiles from Likes. The model correctly discriminates between homosexual and heterosexual men in 88{\%} of cases, African Americans and Caucasian Americans in 95{\%} of cases, and between Democrat and Republican in 85{\%} of cases. For the personality trait "Openness," prediction accuracy is close to the test-retest accuracy of a standard personality test. We give examples of associations between attributes and Likes and discuss implications for online personalization and privacy.},

Drawing on social contract theory, the proposed research model connects a series of psychological factors (prior nega- tive experience, information privacy concerns, perceived ubiquity, trust, and perceived risk) and preference for degree of regulatory control. Data from a survey of 510 mobile phone users in Japan show that mobile users with prior negative experiences with information disclosure possess elevated privacy concerns and perceive stronger risk, which leads them to prefer stricter regulatory controls in mobile advertising. Both perceived ubiquity and sensitivity of the information request further the negative impact of privacy concerns on trust. No such effect occurs for the impact of privacy concerns on perceived risk, however. The authors discuss some theoretical and managerial implications.},

Google is to surveillance capitalism what General Motors was to managerial capitalism. Therefore the institutionalizing practices and operational assumptions of Google Inc. are the primary lens for this analysis as they are rendered in two recent articles authored by Google Chief Economist Hal Varian. Varian asserts four uses that follow from computer-mediated transactions: âdata extraction and analysis,' ânew contractual forms due to better monitoring,' âpersonalization and customization,' and âcontinuous experiments.' An examination of the nature and consequences of these uses sheds light on the implicit logic of surveillance capitalism and the global architecture of computer mediation upon which it depends. This architecture produces a distributed and largely uncontested new expression of power that I christen: âBig Other.' It is constituted by unexpected and often illegible mechanisms of extraction, commodification, and control that effectively exile persons from their own behavior while producing new markets of behavioral prediction and modification. Surveillance capitalism challenges democratic norms and departs in key ways from the centuries long evolution of market capitalism.},

The first touch model is based on a Gaussian Process regression approach and implicitly models the inherent uncertainty of the touching process. The second touch model allows users to explicitly control the uncertainty via touch pressure. Using the first model we show that the character error rate can be reduced by up to 7{\%} over a baseline method, and by up to 1.3{\%} over a leading commercial keyboard. Using the second model we demonstrate that providing users with control over input certainty reduces the amount of text users have to correct manually and increases the text entry rate.},

In our study of 56 users, one group was given feedback in the form of a history of location requests, and a second group was given no feedback at all. Our major contribution has been to show that feedback is an important contributing factor towards improving user comfort levels and allaying privacy concerns. Participants' privacy concerns were reduced after using the mobile location sharing system. Additionally,our study suggests that peer opinion and technical savviness contribute most to whether or not participants thought they would continue to use a mobile location technology.},

abstract = {The blind application of machine learning runs the risk of amplifying biases present in data. Such a danger is facing us with word embedding, a popular framework to represent text data as vectors which has been used in many machine learning and natural language processing tasks. We show that even word embeddings trained on Google News articles exhibit female/male gender stereotypes to a disturbing extent. This raises concerns because their widespread use, as we describe, often tends to amplify these biases. Geometrically, gender bias is first shown to be captured by a direction in the word embedding. Second, gender neutral words are shown to be linearly separable from gender definition words in the word embedding. Using these properties, we provide a methodology for modifying an embedding to remove gender stereotypes, such as the association between the words receptionist and female, while maintaining desired associations such as between the words queen and female. Using crowd-worker evaluation as well as standard benchmarks, we empirically demonstrate that our algorithms significantly reduce gender bias in embeddings while preserving the its useful properties such as the ability to cluster related concepts and to solve analogy tasks. The resulting embeddings can be used in applications without amplifying gender bias.},

abstract = {The hypothesis of this work is that social TV can add to traditional TV audiencehood a sense of collective belonging--"we the public"--that is fundamental for any political action. After a quantitative account of users patterns of activity during half a TV season, a qualitative methodology is adopted to understand the variety of social TV logics. Thus, a model of four different kinds and meanings of using social TV is developed: from the most engaged (civic-informative use of social TV) to the most recreational (the game use), from the outburst of emotions (emotional use) to the identity-building and awareness use. Each of those represents various forms of relationships among individuals in a social medium environment, and between them and other actors of the wider contemporary mediated public space, such as civic and political groups, and political news media professionals.},

Webpages are increasingly composed of content from myriad unrelated âthird-partyâ websites in the business of advertising, analytics, social networking, and more. Third- party services have tremendous value: they support free content and facilitate web innovation.

This paper surveys the current policy debate surrounding third-party web tracking and explains the relevant technology.

abstract = {Location-based advertising (LBA) allows the delivery of advertising messages to consumers in places that are known for their particular high and positive advertising effect. While LBA is recognized for static roadside billboards and the Web, LBA can now be found on mobile devices. This mobile advertising adds valuable opportunities for companies: it allows consumers to be addressed (i) individually, (ii) based on their current location, and (iii) dynamically in real-time; furthermore, (iv) content may be replaced quickly by remote access. Accordingly, within the mobile marketing domain, LBA on mobile devices turns over a new leaf. This young research field is interdisciplinary at its core and marketing and technical experts expect major impetus. To contribute to this growing field, we systematically analyze and evaluate existing literature in the field of LBA on mobile devices, and present the results of six analyses. By building bridges between the involved disciplines, we present existing research in a condensed, concise and evaluating form which will support researchers in orienting for future research in the field. Furthermore, we pinpoint selected "white spots" in research and draw attention to promising areas for future research and directions of future development trends.},

abstract = {This paper reconceptualises the role of the small âlocalâ newspaper in a new media environment and argues that definitions and concepts currently used to describe and define such publications are becoming increasingly problematic as newspapers shift into both print and online formats. The paper highlights the continued importance of geography for such newspapers at a time when there is wide academic debate on the relevance of territory and boundaries and the impact of timeâspace compression in a new media world. It argues, however, that a focus on a newspaper's geographic connection must also acknowledge the increasing boundlessness and openness of the social space in which a newspaper operates. Ultimately this paper suggests the concept of âgeo-socialâ news may be a more appropriate framework for scholars to consider such publications. I draw on the work of geography scholars, and discussions around âspaceâ and âplaceâ to construct the notion of âgeo-socialâ news, highlighting some exemplars of small commercial newsroom practices in Australia, the United Kingdom and Canada and discussions with newspaper editors in Australia to demonstrate the relevance of the âgeo-socialâ concept.},

The GDPR refers to these categories as sensitive personal data. This paper quantifies the portion of Facebook users in the European Union (EU) who were labeled with interests linked to potentially sensitive personal data in the period prior to when GDPR went into effect. The results of our study suggest that Facebook labels 73{\%} EU users with potential sensitive interests. This corresponds to 40{\%} of the overall EU population. We also estimate that a malicious third party could unveil the identity of Facebook users that have been assigned a potentially sensitive interest at a cost as low as e0.015 per user. Finally, we propose and implement a web browser extension to inform Facebook users of the potentially sensitive interests Facebook has assigned them.},

Analyzing results for six types of important queries (e.g. most popular, trending, expensive advertising), we observe that Wikipedia appears in over 80{\%} of results pages for some query types and is by far the most prevalent individual content source across all query types. More generally, our results provide empirical information to inform a nascent but rapidly growing debate surrounding a highly-consequential question: Do users provide enough value to intelligent technologies that they should receive more of the economic benefits from intelligent technologies?},

We study the advertising system of the largest online social network, Facebook, and the risks that the design of the system poses to the privacy of its users. We propose, describe and provide experimental evidence of several novel approaches to exploiting the advertising system in order to obtain private user information. The work illustrates how a real-world system designed with an intention to protect privacy but without rigorous privacy guarantees can leak private information, and motivates the need for further research on the design of microtargeted advertising systems with provable privacy guarantees. Furthermore, it shows that user privacy may be breached not only as a result of data publishing using improper anonymization techniques, but also as a result of internal data-mining of that data. We communicated our findings to Facebook on July 13, 2010, and received a very prompt response. On July 20, 2010, Facebook launched a change to their advertising system that made the kind of attacks we describe much more difficult to implement in practice, even though, as we discuss, they remain possible in principle. We conclude by discussing the broader challenge of designing privacy-preserving microtargeted advertising systems.},

abstract = {The increasing popularity of adblockers has prompted online publishers to retaliate against adblock users by deploying anti-adblock scripts, which detect adblock users and bar them from accessing content unless they disable their adblocker. To circumvent anti-adblockers, adblockers rely on manually curated anti-adblock filter lists for removing anti-adblock scripts. Anti-adblock filter lists currently rely on informal crowdsourced feedback from users to add/remove filter list rules. In this paper, we present the first comprehensive study of anti-adblock filter lists to analyze their effectiveness against anti-adblockers. Specifically, we compare and contrast the evolution of two popular anti-adblock filter lists. We show that these filter lists are implemented very differently even though they currently have a comparable number of filter list rules. We then use the Internet Archive's Wayback Machine to conduct a retrospective coverage analysis of these filter lists on Alexa top-5K websites over the span of last five years. We find that the coverage of these filter lists has considerably improved since 2014 and they detect anti-adblockers on about 9{\%} of Alexa top-5K websites. To improve filter list coverage and speedup addition of new filter rules, we also design and implement a machine learning based method to automatically detect anti-adblock scripts using static JavaScript code analysis.},

abstract = {Our consumption of online information is mediated by filtering, ranking, and recommendation algorithms that introduce unintentional biases as they attempt to deliver relevant and engaging content. It has been suggested that our reliance on online technologies such as search engines and social media may limit exposure to diverse points of view and make us vulnerable to manipulation by disinformation. In this paper, we mine a massive dataset of Web traffic to quantify two kinds of bias: (i) homogeneity bias, which is the tendency to consume content from a narrow set of information sources, and (ii) popularity bias, which is the selective exposure to content from top sites. Our analysis reveals different bias levels across several widely used Web platforms. Search exposes users to a diverse set of sources, while social media traffic tends to exhibit high popularity and homogeneity bias. When we focus our analysis on traffic to news sites, we find higher levels of popularity bias, with smaller differences across applications. Overall, our results quantify the extent to which our choices of online systems confine us inside "social bubbles."},

Should fairness consist of ensuring everyone has an equal probability of obtaining some benefit, or should we aim instead to minimise the harms to the least advantaged? Can the relevant ideal be determined by reference to some alternative state of affairs in which a particular social pattern of discrimination does not exist? Various definitions proposed in recent literature make different assumptions about what terms like discrimination and fairness mean and how they can be defined in mathematical terms. Questions of discrimination, egalitarianism and justice are of significant interest to moral and political philosophers, who have expended significant efforts in formalising and defending these central concepts. It is therefore unsurprising that attempts to formalise `fairness' in machine learning contain echoes of these old philosophical debates. This paper draws on existing work in moral and political philosophy in order to elucidate emerging debates about fair machine learning.},

To deal with the growing amount of information on the social web and the burden it brings on the average user, these gatekeepers recently started to introduce personalization features, algorithms that filter information per individual. In this paper we show that these online services that filter information are not merely algorithms. Humans not only affect the design of the algorithms, but they also can manually influence the filtering process even when the algorithm is operational. We further analyze filtering processes in detail, show how personalization connects to other filtering techniques, and show that both human and technical biases are present in today's emergent gatekeepers. We use the existing literature on gatekeeping and search engine bias and provide a model of algorithmic gatekeeping.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

Our identification strategy exploits the precise timing of these events and allows for the possibility of confounding trends. We find that newspapers have a robust positive effect on political participation, with one additional newspaper increasing both presidential and congressional turnout by approximately 0:3 percentage points. Newspaper competition is not a key driver of turnout: our effect is driven mainly by the first newspaper in a market, and the effect of a second or third paper is significantly smaller. The effect on presidential turnout diminishes after the introduction of radio and television, while the estimated effect on congressional turnout remains similar up to recent years. We find no evidence that partisan newspapers affect party vote shares, with confidence intervals that rule out even moderate-sized effects. We find no clear evidence that newspapers systematically help or hurt incumbents.},

@book{ONeil,
abstract = {First edition. We live in the age of the algorithm. Increasingly, the decisions that affect our lives (where we go to school, whether we get a car loan, how much we pay for health insurance) are being made not by humans, but by mathematical models. In theory, this should lead to greater fairness: everyone is judged according to the same rules, and bias is eliminated. But as Cathy O'Neil reveals in this book, the opposite is true. The models being used today are opaque, unregulated, and uncontestable, even when they are wrong. Most troubling, they reinforce discrimination: if a poor student can't get a loan because a lending model deems him too risky (by virtue of his zip code), he is then cut off from the kind of education that could pull him out of poverty, and a vicious spiral ensues. Models are propping up the lucky and punishing the downtrodden, creating a 'toxic cocktail for democracy.' Welcome to the dark side of big data. Tracing the arc of a person's life, O'Neil exposes the black box models that shape our future, both as individuals and as a society. These 'weapons of math destruction' score teachers and students, sort reÌsumeÌs, grant (or deny) loans, evaluate workers, target voters, set parole, and monitor our health. O'Neil calls on modelers to take more responsibility for their algorithms and on policy makers to regulate their use. But in the end, it is up to us to become more savvy about the models that govern our lives. We live in the age of the algorithm. Increasingly, the decisions that affect our lives -- where we go to school, whether we get a car loan, how much we pay for health insurance -- are being made not by humans, but by mathematical models. In theory, this should lead to greater fairness: Everyone is judged according to the same rules, and bias is eliminated. But as Cathy O'Neil reveals in this book, the opposite is true. The models being used today are opaque, unregulated, and uncontestable, even when they're wrong. Most troubling, they reinforce discrimination: If a poor student can't get a loan because a lending model deems him too risky (by virtue of his zip code), he's then cut off from the kind of education that could pull him out of poverty, and a vicious spiral ensues. Models are propping up the lucky and punishing the downtrodden, creating a 'toxic cocktail for democracy.' Welcome to the dark side of Big Data.

abstract = {n offering personalized content geared toward users' individual interests, recommender systems are assumed to reduce news diversity and thus lead to partial information blindness (i.e., filter bubbles). We conducted two exploratory studies to test the effect of both implicit and explicit personalization on the content and source diversity of Google News. Except for small effects of implicit personalization on content diversity, we found no support for the filter-bubble hypothesis. We did, however, find a general bias in that Google News over-represents certain news outlets and under-represents other, highly frequented, news outlets. The results add to a growing body of evidence, which suggests that concerns about algorithmic filter bubbles in the context of online news might be exaggerated.},

abstract = {A dominant regulatory model for web privacy is "notice and choice". In this model, users are notified of data collection and provided with options to control it. To examine the efficacy of this approach, this study presents the first large-scale audit of disclosure of third-party data collection in website privacy policies. Data flows on one million websites are analyzed and over 200,000 websites' privacy policies are audited to determine if users are notified of the names of the companies which collect their data. Policies from 25 prominent third-party data collectors are also examined to provide deeper insights into the totality of the policy environment. Policies are additionally audited to determine if the choice expressed by the "Do Not Track" browser setting is respected. Third-party data collection is widespread , but fewer than 15{\%} of attributed data flows are disclosed. The third-parties most likely to be disclosed are those with consumer services users may be aware of, those without consumer services are less likely to be mentioned. Policies are difficult to understand and the average time requirement to read both a given site's policy and the associated third-party policies exceeds 84 minutes. Only 7{\%} of first-party site policies mention the Do Not Track signal, and the majority of such mentions are to specify that the signal is ignored. Among third-party policies examined, none offer unqualified support for the Do Not Track signal. Findings indicate that current implementations of "notice and choice" fail to provide notice or respect choice.

Many applications of geotagged content are predicated on the concept of localness (e.g., local restaurant recommendation, mining social media for local perspectives on an issue). However, definitions of who is a "local" in a given area are typically informal and ad-hoc and, as a result, approaches for localness assessment that have been used in the past have not been formally validated. In this paper, we begin the process of addressing these gaps in the literature. Specifically, we (1) formalize definitions of "local" using themes identified in a 30-paper literature review, (2) develop the first ground truth localness dataset consisting of 132 Twitter users and 58,945 place-tagged tweets, and (3) use this dataset to evaluate existing localness assessment approaches. Our results provide important methodological guidance to the large body of research and practice that depends on the concept of localness and suggest means by which localness assessment can be improved.},

abstract = {Measuring the causal effects of digital advertising remains challenging despite the availability of granular data. Unobservable factors make exposure endogenous, and advertising's effect on outcomes tends to be small. In principle, these concerns could be addressed using randomized controlled trials (RCTs). In practice, few online ad campaigns rely on RCTs, and instead use observational methods to estimate ad effects. We assess empirically whether the variation in data typically available in the advertising industry enables observational methods to recover the causal effects of online advertising. This analysis is of particular interest because of recent, large improvements in observational methods for causal inference (Imbens {\&} Rubin, 2015). Using data from 15 US advertising experiments at Facebook comprising 500 million user-experiment observations and 1.6 billion ad impressions, we contrast the experimental results to those obtained from multiple observational models. The observational methods often fail to produce the same effects as the randomized experiments, even after conditioning on extensive demographic and behavioral variables. We also characterize the incremental explanatory power our data would require to enable observational methods to successfully measure advertising effects. Our findings suggest that commonly used observational approaches based on the data usually available in the industry often fail to accurately measure the true effect of advertising.},

For EuropeanâAfrican consortia conducting research that may affect the privacy of African citizens, the question is `how to protect personal data of data subjects while at the same time ensuring a just distribution of the benefits of a global digital ecosystem?' We use location privacy as a point of departure, because information about an individual's location is different from other kinds of personally identifiable information. We analyse privacy at two levels, individual and cultural. Our perspective is interdisciplinary: we draw from computer science to describe three scenarios of transformation of volunteered or observed information to inferred information about a natural person and from cultural theory to distinguish four privacy cultures emerging within the EU in the wake of GDPR. We highlight recent data protection legislation in the AU and discuss factors that may accelerate or inhibit the alignment of data protection legislation in the AU with the GDPR.},

abstract = {Within higher education, journalism studies is often seen as an uncomfortable bedfellow with journalism training; there is evidence of a pervasive disconnect between research and teaching, as between theory and practice. However, voices within journalism education are calling for a more critical curriculum informed by scholarly research. There are suggestions that the journalists now doing much of the teaching within university journalism departments could play a key role in establishing a more critical journalism education and, by doing so, contributing towards more critical forms of journalism. Within this context, do journalists-turned-journalism-educators see any point in researching journalism or would they rather simply pass on vocational skills to the next generation? This article is based on asking a sample group of such âhackademics' working in UK and/or Irish universities about the utility of scholarly inquiry into journalism. The article suggests that exploring ostensibly âbleeding obvious' aspects of journalism may not be the pointless exercise derided by some commentators; rather, it could be precisely what journalism educators ought to be doing.},

@book{Schudson1995,
abstract = {Some say it's simply information, mirroring the world. Others believe it's propaganda, promoting a partisan view. But news, Michael Schudson tells us, is really both and neither; it is a form of culture, complete with its own literary and social conventions and powerful in ways far more subtle and complex than its many critics might suspect. A penetrating look into this culture, The Power of News offers a compelling view of the news media's emergence as a central institution of modern society, a key repository of common knowledge and cultural authority.One of our foremost writers on journalism and mass communication, Schudson shows us the news evolving in concert with American democracy and industry, subject to the social forces that shape the culture at large. He excavates the origins of contemporary journalistic practices, including the interview, the summary lead, the preoccupation with the presidency, and the ironic and detached stance of the reporter toward the political world. His book explodes certain myths perpetuated by both journalists and critics. The press, for instance, did not bring about the Spanish-American War or bring down Richard Nixon; TV did not decide the Kennedy-Nixon debates or turn the public against the Vietnam War.Then what does the news do? True to their calling, the media mediate, as Schudson demonstrates. He analyzes how the news, by making knowledge public, actually changes the character of knowledge and allows people to act on that knowledge in new and significant ways. He brings to bear a wealth of historical scholarship and a keen sense for the apt questions about the production, meaning, and reception of news today.},

abstract = {Target collects customer data to predict future purchasing behavior. Equifax's modus operandi is selling aggregated user data. Facebook creates an advertisement profile for users based on their site activity. Understandably (in some cases), companies use personal information as a tool for targeted marketing, which drives consumer spending and higher profits. Although the data collected may seem basic and harmless, the combined information can have the power to not only predict and alter behavior, but also steal one's identity. With the number of breaches happening daily, the amount of data stored by these companies should be a concern. Sadly, it is not in the company's interest to protect user information. The paper will discuss some of the major breaches in the past few years, as well as changes implemented to prevent future breaches. It will also explore the European Union's latest data protection law and steps consumers can take to protect their personal information. Introduction Leaked user information is a common headline nowadays. Companies like Target, Equifax, Facebook, and Google were all involved in incidents where customer information was exposed. Consumer's names, email addresses, credit card numbers, and even Social Security numbers were among the types of information that was leaked or stolen (Table 1). The exploits came in different flavors: malware, out-of-date software, oversight on third-party permissions, and bugs. The leaks ranged from half a million user profiles from Google to 148 million people from Equifax due to their out-of-date software (Table 2). To give some perspective, Equifax's breach affected about 45{\%} of the United States population. While it is important to understand how these attacks or leaks occurred, it is equally important to understand why these companies need to store sensitive information and what consumers can do to protect their personal information.},

abstract = {In political communication research, news media tend to be studied more as a de- pendent than independent variable. That is, few studies link structural characteris- tics of media systems to the production of journalistic discourse about politics. One reason for this relative silence is the inadequacy of prevalent theories. Influential scholars in sociology and political communication such as J{\"{u}}rgen Habermas, Manuel Castells, and William Gamson provide only sketchy, institutionally underspecified accounts of media systems. Likewise, models in the sociology of news have tended to either aggregate societal level influences (chiefly political and economic) that are analytically and often empirically quite distinct or overemphasize micro-level influ- ences (news routines, bureaucratic pressures). In between such micro- and macro- influences, the mezzo-level âjournalistic fieldâ represents an important shaping fac- tor heretofore largely ignored. As path-dependent institutional logics, fields help ground cultural analysis; as interorganizational spatial environments varying in their level of concentration, they explain heretofore undertheorized aspects of news pro- duction. Drawing on the sociology of news and field theory (Bourdieu and Ameri- can new institutionalism), this essay offers a series of hypotheses about how vari- able characteristics of media systems shape news discourse. Since variation at the system level is most clearly seen via cross-national comparative studies, interna- tional research is best positioned to build more generalizable theory about the pro- duction of journalistically mediated political discourse.},

Research about these media has grown dramatically, especially in the past few years, but there have been few reviews of this research and none of the most recent scholarship. This article reviews scholarship on online news production published since 2000. It examines research on five key topics: historical context and market environment, the process of innovation, alterations in journalistic practices, challenges to established professional dynamics, and the role of user-generated content. A tension between tradition and change emerges from this discussion and is evident at two levels. First, the world of practice seems to straddle the re-enactment of established forms and tinkering with alternative pathways. Second, the modes of inquiry oscillate between using existing concepts to look at new phenomena and taking advantage of these phenomena to rethink these concepts and come up with new ones. The article concludes by identifying shortcomings in the existing scholarship and suggesting avenues for future studies to overcome them. It suggests how scholarship on online news production could contribute to rethinking some of the fundamental building blocks of understanding communication and society in the contemporary media environment.},

And how to think about the politics and governance of something that is so difficult to grasp?

abstract = {Location uncertainty is often ignored but a key context parameter for location-based services. The standard way of visualizing location uncertainty on mobile devices is using a concentric circle. However, the impact of different visual variables (shape, size, boundary, middle dot, color) of this standard visualization on users is not well understood. There is a potential for misinterpretation, particularly across cultures. We ran a study that was previously conducted in Germany (N=32) in Sri Lanka (N=20) to investigate how users perceive different visualizations of location uncertainty on mobile devices. In particular, we investigated the impact of the four graphic dimensions, shape, boundary, middle dot and size. We identified consistencies and inconsistencies concerning perceptions of users regarding visualizations of location uncertainty across cultures. We also quantified the impact of different visualizations on the perception of users. Based on the consistencies between different visualizations and between the two cultures, we derived guidelines for visualizing location uncertainty that help developers in aligning location uncertainty with the perceptions of users. We also highlight the need for further research on cultural differences (and similarities) regarding how visualizations of location uncertainty impact the perceptions of users.},

abstract = {Twitter's success has made it a rich research site for scholars interested in online 12 interaction, information dissemination, activism, and a plethora of other subjects. The sheer 13 volume of users, tweets, and hashtags has made the site a favourite for quantitative data analysis 14 and " big data " number-crunching. For instance, in an early study of Twitter, Krishnamurthy, 15 Gill, and Arlitt (2008) collected information about nearly 100,000 users, including number of 16 accounts followed, number of accounts following them, and frequency of status updates. The 17 authors created a taxonomy of Twitter users, grouping them into broadcasters, acquaintances, 18 miscreants, and evangelists based on the ratio of following-to-follower. Similarly, Java, Song, 19 Finin, and Tseng (2007) used a sample of 1.3 million tweets from 76,177 users to describe why 20 people use Twitter, which they summarized as " information sharing, information seeking, and 21 friendship-wise relationship [sic] " (p. 60). While such studies are valuable, inferences made on 22 the basis of the properties of a large data set are limited in what they can explain. In the latter 23 study, asking people about their motivations for using Twitter would probably reveal an array of 24 interesting motivations that do not neatly map on to these three groups. Because Twitter is such 25 a vast network with so many user groups, simply collecting a great deal of data may not be 26 adequate for describing use beyond simple queries. Qualitative methods, such as interviews, 27 ethnographic observations, and content analysis, provide a rich source of data that allow us to go 28 beyond description. For instance, qualitative methods can help unpack user presumptions about 29 individual technologies, distinguishing general communicative or social media behaviour from 30 behaviour that is specific to a platform. 31 Qualitative methods can also reveal much about social norms, appropriateness, or larger 32 social concerns about technology. Twitter's breadth and diversity requires recognizing that 33 different user groups have different social norms and idioms of practice (Gershon, 2010). 34 Generalizations made about one hashtag, meme, or network of users may not apply to another, 35 providing only a small portion of the picture. Qualitative research allows scholars to investigate 36 the practices of a particular user group, as it can go beyond tracking follower counts or hashtag 37 use to include many more sources of input about a specific community or user segment. 38 Moreover, qualitative data can often be useful for triangulating and augmenting quantitative 39 results (see, for example, Honeycutt {\&} Herring, 2009; Naaman, Becker, {\&} Gravano, 2011). This 40 chapter discusses a variety of qualitative research methods, including interviews, ethnographic 41 fieldwork, and textual analysis. 42 43 Interviews 44 45},

abstract = {News platforms exhibit both the challenges as well as opportunities for enhancing the functionalities of recommendation systems in today's big data environment. Novel use of big data storage and programming models can improve news recommendation systems through efficient handling and analysis of clickstream data and a better understanding of users' interests. Most existing approaches to news recommendation consider users' clicks as the implicit feedback to understand user behaviors. However, âclicksâ may not be an effective indicator of real user interests. We address this problem by developing a novel news recommendation system based on a news utility model. Given the new utility model, we propose a two stage news recommendation framework. The framework first generates article-level recommendation rules based on the utility model, then integrates the notion of utility and probabilistic topic models and generates topic-level recommendation rules. We argue that the proposed utility-based news recommendation system also addresses the news cold start problem which is one of the most challenging obstacles for news agencies. We evaluate the framework on a massive real dataset (two billion records) obtained from a major newspaper (i.e., The Globe and Mail) in Canada and show that it outperforms the existing methods.},

abstract = {While extensive research has investigated the risks of children sharing their personal information online, little work has investigated the implications of parents sharing personal information about their children online. Drawing on 102 interviews with parents, we investigate how parents decide what to disclose about their children on social network sites (SNSs). We find that mothers take on the responsibility of sharing content about their children more than fathers do. Fathers are more restrictive about sharing to broad and professional audiences and are concerned about sharing content that could be perceived as sexually suggestive. Both mothers and fathers work to leverage affordances of SNSs to limit oversharing. Building on prior work, we introduce the concept of parental disclosure management, which describes how parents decide what to share about their children online. We also describe an emerging third shift of work that highlights the additional work parents take on to manage children's identities online. We conclude with theoretical and practical implications for designing SNSs to better support family life online.},

Our tool, TrackingExcavator, leverages a key insight: that the Internet Archive's Wayback Machine opens the possibility for a retrospective analysis of tracking over time. We contribute an evaluation of the Wayback Machine's view of past third-party requests, which we find is imperfect we evaluate its limitations and unearth lessons and strategies for overcoming them. Applying these strategies in our measurements, we discover (among other findings) that third-party tracking on the web has increased in prevalence and complexity since the first third-party tracker that we observe in 1996, and we see the spread of the most popular trackers to an increasing percentage of the most popular sites on the web. We argue that an understanding of the ecosystem's historical trends-which we provide for the first time at this scale in our work-is important to any technical and policy discussions surrounding tracking.},

abstract = {It has been argued that the Internet and social media increase the number of available viewpoints, perspectives, ideas and opinions available, leading to a very diverse pool of information. However, critics have argued that algorithms used by search engines, social networking platforms and other large online intermediaries actually decrease information diversity by forming so-called âfilter bubblesâ. This may form a serious threat to our democracies. In response to this threat others have developed algorithms and digital tools to combat filter bubbles. This paper first provides examples of different software designs that try to break filter bubbles. Secondly, we show how norms required by two democracy models dominate the tools that are developed to fight the filter bubbles, while norms of other models are completely missing in the tools. The paper in conclusion argues that democracy itself is a contested concept and points to a variety of norms. Designers of diversity enhancing tools must thus be exposed to diverse conceptions of democracy.},

This has resulted in newspaper closures, staff cuts, and dramatic changes to the ways many newspapers cover local government, among other topics. This article argues that the loss of professional expertise in coverage of local government has negative consequences for the quality of city politics because citizens become less informed about local policies and elections. We test our theory using an original data set that matches 11 local newspapers in California to the municipalities they cover. The data show that cities served by newspapers with relatively sharp declines in newsroom staffing had, on average, significantly reduced political competition in mayoral races. We also find suggestive evidence that lower staffing levels are associated with lower voter turnout.},

abstract = {Social media sites use different labels to help users find and select news feeds. For example, Blue Feed, Red Feed, a news feed created by the Wall Street Journal, use stance labels to separate news articles with opposing political ideologies to help people explore diverse opinions. To combat the spread of fake news, Facebook has experimented with putting credibility labels on news articles to help readers decide whether the content is trustworthy. To systematically understand the effects of stance and credibility labels on online news selection and consumption, we conducted a controlled experiment to study how these labels influence the selection, perceived extremeness, and level of agreement of news articles. Results show that stance labels may intensify selective exposure-a tendency for people to look for agreeable opinions-and make people more vulnerable to polarized opinions and fake news. We found, however, that the effect of credibility labels on reducing selective exposure and recognizing fake news is limited. Although originally designed to encourage exposure to opposite viewpoints, stance labels can make fake news articles look more trustworthy, and they may lower people's perception of the extremeness of fake news articles. Our results have important implications on the subtle effects of stance and credibility labels on online news consumption.},

Yet, in recent theorisations, there is a risk that the algorithm is being given too much prominence. This article addresses the interaction between algorithmic outputs and the humans engaging with them by drawing on studies of two distinct empirical fields â self-quantification and audit controls of taxpayers. We explore recalibration as a way to understand the practices and processes involved when, on the one hand, decisions are made based on results from algorithmic calculations in counting and accounting software, and on the other hand, when decisions are made based on human experience/knowledge. In particular, we are concerned with moments when an algorithmic output differs from expectations of ânormalcy' and ânormativity' in any given situation. This could be a ânormal' relation between sales and VAT deductions for a business, or a ânormal' number of steps one takes in a day, or ânormative' as it is according to the book, following guidelines and recommendations from other sources. In these moments, we argue that a process of recalibration occurs â an effortful moment where, rather than treat the algorithmic output as given, individuals' tacit knowledge, experiences and intuition are brought into play to address the deviation from the normal and normative.},

We found serious usability flaws in all tools we tested. Participants found many tools difficult to configure, and tools' default settings were often minimally protective. Ineffective communication, confusing interfaces, and a lack of feedback led many participants to conclude that a tool was blocking OBA when they had not properly configured it to do so.

Wikipedia provides substantial value to both communities, with Wikipedia content increasing visitation, engagement, and revenue, but we find little evidence that these websites contribute to Wikipedia in return. Overall, these findings highlight important connections between Wikipedia and its broader ecosystem that should be considered by researchers studying Wikipedia. Critically, our results also emphasize the key role that volunteer-created Wikipedia content plays in improving other websites, even contributing to revenue generation.},

abstract = {Through a combination of network ethnography and more traditional, qualitative newsroom analysis, this article undertakes a step-by-step analysis of the circulation of a particular set of news factsâthose relating to the eviction and arrest of a group of homeowners in Philadelphia during a single week in June 2008, a time period in which the story of the arrests emerged, exploded, and then quickly faded away. The article discusses some of the larger explanatory factors that might have contributed to the particular pattern of news diffusion described here, as well as the degree to which the factors observed might be generalizable across other cases. The article adds local nuance to Benkler's (2006) description of information circulation in the networked public sphere, pointing to a pattern of iterative pyramiding in which key Web sites positioned within highly particular communities of interest act as bridges to larger, more diffused digital communities. The article also argues that news movement in the particular incident discussed can be characterized by an unusual combination of fact-entrepreneurship and a process of categorical misrecognition in which the cir-culation dynamics of the networked news ecosystem are leveraged by institutional and quasi-institutional communicative actors to advance particular occupational and pro-fessional goals, all the while misrecognizing both the identity and goals of the other nodes in the Philadelphia media sphere. Overall, the article serves as a preliminary attempt to outline the changing architecture of local journalism ecologies during a period of rapid news industry.},

abstract = {We present a 3-week user study in which we tracked the locations of 27 subjects and asked them to rate when, where, and with whom they would have been comfortable sharing their locations. The results of analysis conducted on over 7,500 h of data suggest that the user population represented by our subjects has rich location-privacy preferences, with a number of critical dimensions, including time of day, day of week, and location. We describe a methodology for quantifying the effects, in terms of accuracy and amount of information shared, of privacy-setting types with differing levels of complexity (e.g., setting types that allow users to specify location- and/or time-based rules). Using the detailed preferences we collected, we identify the best possible policy (or collection of rules granting access to one's location) for each subject and privacy-setting type. We measure the accuracy with which the resulting policies are able to capture our subjects' preferences under a variety of assumptions about the sensitivity of the information and user-burden tolerance. One practical implication of our results is that today's location-sharing applications may have failed to gain much traction due to their limited privacy settings, as they appear to be ineffective at capturing the preferences revealed by our study.},

We investigated this paradox experimentally, by creating an artificial "music market" in which 14,341 participants downloaded previously unknown songs either with or without knowledge of previous participants' choices. Increasing the strength of social influence increased both inequality and unpredictability of success. Success was also only partly determined by quality: The best songs rarely did poorly, and the worst rarely did well, but any other result was possible.},

Information technology is changing our lives in ways that we cannot easily foresee. As dramatic as the impacts have been already, they are just beginning. The digital age is creating an information and communications renaissance. But it is not serving all Americans and their local communities equally. It is not yet serving democracy fully. How we react, individually and collectively, to this democratic shortfall will affect the quality of our lives and the very nature of our communities. America needs informed communities, places where the information ecology meets peoples personal and civic information needs. This means people have the news and information they need to take advantage of lifes opportunities for themselves and their families. They need information to participate fully in our system of self-government, to stand up and be heard. Driving this vision are the critical democratic values of openness, inclusion, participation, empowerment, and the common pursuit of truth and the public interest.},

abstract = {âIn this paper, we quantify the effectiveness of third-party tracker blockers on a large scale. First, we analyze the architecture of various state-of-the-art blocking solutions and discuss the advantages and disadvantages of each method. Second, we perform a two-part measurement study on the effectiveness of popular tracker-blocking tools. Our analysis quantifies the protection offered against trackers present on more than 100,000 popular websites and 10,000 popular An-droid applications. We provide novel insights into the ongoing arms race between trackers and developers of blocking tools as well as which tools achieve the best results under what circumstances. Among others, we discover that rule-based browser extensions outperform learning-based ones, trackers with smaller footprints are more successful at avoiding being blocked, and CDNs pose a major threat towards the future of tracker-blocking tools. Overall, the contributions of this paper advance the field of web privacy by providing not only the largest study to date on the effectiveness of tracker-blocking tools, but also by highlighting the most pressing challenges and privacy issues of third-party tracking.},

In this paper, we use influence functions a classic technique from robust statistics to trace a model's prediction through the learning algorithm and back to its training data, thereby identifying training points most responsible for a given prediction. To scale up influence functions to modern machine learning settings, we develop a simple, efficient implementation that requires only oracle access to gradients and Hessian-vector products. We show that even on non-convex and non-differentiable models where the theory breaks down, approximations to influence functions can still provide valuable information. On linear models and convolutional neu-ral networks, we demonstrate that influence functions are useful for multiple purposes: understanding model behavior, debugging models, detecting dataset errors, and even creating visually-indistinguishable training-set attacks.},

Participants 1223 trick-or-treaters in New Haven over three years; on average, 8.5 years old and 53{\%} male (among children whose gender was identifiable). Eligibility Trick-or-treaters over the age of three that approached the house. Intervention Random assignment to the Michelle Obama side of the porch or the Comparison side of the porch. Main outcome measure Selection of fruit over candy. Methods Difference-in-means estimates. Results We estimate that viewing a photograph of Michelle Obama's face relative to control conditions caused children to be 19{\%} more likely to choose fruit over candy. Conclusions Michelle Obama's initiative to reduce childhood obesity has influenced children's dietary preferences. Whether this influence extends beyond Halloween trick-or-treating in New Haven, CT on the porch of an economics professor requires further research.},

In this work, we present an approach to evaluate bias present in automated facial analysis algorithms and datasets with respect to phe-notypic subgroups. Using the dermatologist approved Fitzpatrick Skin Type classification system, we characterize the gender and skin type distribution of two facial analysis benchmarks, IJB-A and Adience. We find that these datasets are overwhelmingly composed of lighter-skinned subjects (79.6{\%} for IJB-A and 86.2{\%} for Adience) and introduce a new facial analysis dataset which is balanced by gender and skin type. We evaluate 3 commercial gender classification systems using our dataset and show that darker-skinned females are the most misclassified group (with error rates of up to 34.7{\%}). The maximum error rate for lighter-skinned males is 0.8{\%}. The substantial disparities in the accuracy of classifying darker females, lighter females, darker males, and lighter males in gender classification systems require urgent attention if commercial companies are to build genuinely fair, transparent and accountable facial analysis algorithms.},

abstract = {To partly address people's concerns over web tracking, Google has created the Ad Settings webpage to provide information about and some choice over the profiles Google creates on users. We present AdFisher, an automated tool that explores how user behaviors, Google's ads, and Ad Settings interact. AdFisher can run browser-based experiments and analyze data using machine learning and significance tests. Our tool uses a rigorous experimental design and statistical analysis to ensure the statistical soundness of our results. We use AdFisher to find that the Ad Settings was opaque about some features of a user's profile, that it does provide some choice on ads, and that these choices can lead to seemingly discriminatory ads. In particular, we found that visiting webpages associated with substance abuse changed the ads shown but not the settings page. We also found that setting the gender to female resulted in getting fewer instances of an ad related to high paying jobs than setting it to male. We cannot determine who caused these findings due to our limited visibility into the ad ecosystem, which includes Google, advertisers, websites, and users. Nevertheless, these results can form the starting point for deeper investigations by either the companies themselves or by regulatory bodies.},

abstract = {While the impact of targeted advertising on advertisers' campaign effectiveness has been vastly documented, much less is known about the value generated by online tracking and targeting technologies for publishers-the websites that sell ad spaces. In fact, the conventional wisdom that publishers benefit too from behaviorally targeted advertising has rarely been scrutinized in academic studies. We investigate how the (un)availability of users' cookies, which affects the ability of advertisers to perform be-havioral targeting, impacts publishers' revenues. We leverage a rich dataset of millions of advertising transactions completed across multiple websites owned by a large media company. We implement an augmented version of the inverse probability weighting, a double-robust estimator that allows us to estimate effects even in the presence of potential confounding. We find that when a user's cookie is available publisher's revenue increases by only about 4{\%}. This corresponds to an average increase of {\$}0.00008 per advertisement. The results contribute to the current debate over online behavioral advertising, and how benefits accrued from tracking and targeting online consumers may be differentially allocated to various stakeholders in the advertising ecosystem.},

abstract = {Most commonly used approaches to developing automated or artificially intelligent algorithmic systems are Big Data-driven and machine learning-based. However, these approaches can fail, for two notable reasons: (1) they may lack critical engagement with users and other stakeholders; (2) they rely largely on historical human judgments, which do not capture and incorporate human insights into how the world can be improved in the future. We propose and describe a novel method for the design of such algorithms, which we call Value Sensitive Algorithm Design. Value Sensitive Algorithm Design incorporates stakeholders' tacit knowledge and explicit feedback in the early stages of algorithm creation. This increases the chance to avoid biases in design choices or to compromise key stakeholder values. Generally, we believe that algorithms should be designed to balance multiple stakeholders' needs, motivations, and interests, and to help achieve important collective goals. We also describe a specific project "Designing Intelligent Socialization Algorithms for WikiProjects in Wikipedia" to illustrate our method. We intend this paper to contribute to the rich ongoing conversation concerning the use of algorithms in supporting critical decision-making in society.},

How is it that machine learning can promise to predict with great specificity what differences matter or what people want in many different settings? We need, I suggest, an account of its generalization if we are to understand the contemporary production of prediction. This article maps the principal forms of material action, narrative and problematization that run across algorithmic modelling techniques such as logistic regression, decision trees and Naive Bayes classifiers. It highlights several interlinked modes of generalization that engender increasingly vast data infrastructures and platforms, and intensified mathematical and statistical treatments of differences. Such an account also points to some key sites of instability or problematization inherent to the process of generalization. If movement through data is becoming a principal intersection of power relations, economic value and valid knowledge, an account of the production of prediction might also help us begin to ask how its generalization potentially gives rise to new forms of agency, experience or individuations.},

abstract = {Ranked lists are encountered in research and daily life and it is often of interest to compare these lists even when they are incomplete or have only some members in common. An example is document rankings returned for the same query by different search engines. A measure of the similarity between incomplete rankings should handle nonconjointness, weight high ranks more heavily than low, and be monotonic with increasing depth of evaluation; but no measure satisfying all these criteria currently exists. In this article, we propose a new measure having these qualities, namely rank-biased overlap (RBO). The RBO measure is based on a simple probabilistic user model. It provides monotonicity by calculating, at a given depth of evaluation, a base score that is non-decreasing with additional evaluation, and a maximum score that is nonincreasing. An extrapolated score can be calculated between these bounds if a point estimate is required. RBO has a parameter which determines the strength of the weighting to top ranks. We extend RBO to handle tied ranks and rankings of different lengths. Finally, we give examples of the use of the measure in comparing the results produced by public search engines and in assessing retrieval systems in the laboratory.},

The algorithmic filtering and adaption of online content to personal preferences and interests is often associated with a decrease in the diversity of information to which users are exposed. Notwithstanding the question of whether these claims are correct or not, this article discusses whether and how recommendations can also be designed to stimulate more diverse exposure to information and to break potential âfilter bubbles' rather than create them. Combining insights from democratic theory, computer science and law, the article makes suggestions for design principles and explores the potential and possible limits of âdiversity sensitive design'.},

The BIM was built by combining scores from three different models: the Relevance Status Value (RSV) of the Probability Ranking Principle (PRP) model, Logistic Regression Model's probabilities, and a Weighted Cost Model (WCM). Scaling the queries relevance by the estimated cost by the WCM model relatively scores the queries with lower costs higher ranking.},

We detect 54,758 downstream uses of the initial sample and we characterise these at the level of generic and country-code top-level domains (TLDs). We analyse the impact of specific variables on the odds that an image is used. The random sampling technique enables us to estimate overall value of all images contained on the platform.

How do these online networks influence exposure to perspectives that cut across ideological lines? Using deidentified data,we examined how 10.1million U.S. Facebook users interact with socially shared news.We directlymeasured ideological homophily in friend networks and examined the extent to which heterogeneous friends could potentially expose individuals to cross-cutting content.We then quantified the extent to which individuals encounter comparativelymore or less diverse content while interacting via Facebook's algorithmically rankedNews Feed and further studied users'choices to click through to ideologically discordant content. Compared with algorithmic ranking, individuals' choices played a stronger role in limiting exposure to cross-cutting content. Supplementary mateirals included},

Drawing on research in CSCW, critical data studies, and history and sociology of science, and six months of immersive ethnographic fieldwork with a corporate data science team, we describe four common tensions in applied data science work: (un)equivocal numbers, (counter)intuitive knowledge, (in)credible data, and (in)scrutable models. We show how organizational actors establish and renegotiate trust under messy and uncertain analytic conditions through practices of skepticism, assessment, and credibility. Highlighting the collaborative and heterogeneous nature of real-world data science, we show how the management of trust in applied corporate data science settings depends not only on pre-processing and quantification, but also on negotiation and translation. We conclude by discussing the implications of our findings for data science research and practice, both within and beyond CSCW. ï  CCS Concepts: â¢ Human-centered computing â Collaborative and Social Computing â Empirical Studies in Collaborative and Social Computing},

abstract = {Machines are increasingly aiding or replacing humans in journalistic work, primarily in news distribution. We examined whether news recommendation engines contribute to filter bubbles and fragmented news audiences by asking a diverse set of real-world participants (N = 168), using their personal Google accounts, to search Google News for news about Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump during the 2016 U.S. presidential campaign and report the first five stories they were recommended on each candidate. Users with different political leanings from different states were recommended very similar news, challenging the assumption that algorithms necessarily encourage echo chambers. Yet we also found a very high degree of homogeneity and concentration in the news recommendations. On average, the most recommended five news organizations comprised 69{\%} of all recommendations. Five news organizations alone accounted for 49{\%} of the total number of recommendations collected. Out of 14 organizations that dominated recommendations across the different searches, only three were born-digital, indicating that the news agenda constructed on Google News replicates traditional industry structures more than disrupts them. We use these findings to explore the challenges of studying machine behavior in news from a normative perspective, given the lack of agreed-upon normative standards for humans as news gatekeepers. This article suggests that because there is no one agreed-upon standard for humans as news gatekeepers, assessing the performance of machines in that role is doubly complicated.},

Yet, knowledge about factors influencing news sharing in social media remains limited. Drawing from the uses and gratifications (U{\&}G) and social cognitive theories (SCT), this study explored the influences of information seeking, socializing, entertainment, status seeking and prior social media sharing experience on news sharing intention. A survey was designed and administered to 203 students in a large local university. Results from structural equation modeling (SEM) analysis revealed that respondents who were driven by gratifications of information seeking, socializing, and status seeking were more likely to share news in social media platforms. Prior experience with social media was also a significant determinant of news sharing intention. Implications and directions for future work are discussed. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Both techniques are useful, yet little has been published about their technical specifics and concrete benefits. One reason is that typing accuracy is difficult to measure empirically on a large scale. We describe a closed-loop, smart touch keyboard (STK) evaluation system that we have implemented to solve this problem. It includes a principled typing simulator for generating human-like noisy touch input, a simple-yet-effective decoder for reconstructing typed words from such spatial data, a large web-scale background language model (LM), and a method for incorporating LM personalization. Using the Enron email corpus as a personalization test set, we show for the first time at this scale that a combined spatial-language model reduces word error rate from a pre-model baseline of 38.4{\%} down to 5.7{\%}, and that LM personalization can improve this further to 4.6{\%}.},

Research has thus far typically been framed within journalism studies, discourses of social change, citizen journalism and civic engagement, and has focused on practitioners. Quantitative audience studies have been useful in identifying reader motivations and uses, but richer work exploring everyday narratives is lacking. This paper draws on ethnographic work (online, observing a Facebook page, and offline, attending community events and interviewing audience members) in order to explore the uses and value of such media for the audience of residents. The paper focuses on one aspect of this media, banal stories about lost pets, and suggests that hyperlocal media offers a unique but sometimes problematic platform for community discussions in which readers and editors work together to source, write and share online content to a collaborative end. This paper demonstrates through this prism of animal stories the value of hyperlocal media in offering unique opportunities for residents to be heard and participate within their communities, whilst appreciating the tensions inherent in such an editorially and technologically mediated online space.},

abstract = {Behavioral targeting is an online marketing method that collects data on the browsing activities of consumers, in order to "target" more relevant online advertising. It places digital tags in the browsers of web site visitors, using these tags to track and aggregate consumer behavior. The vast majority of data is collected anonymously, i.e., not linked to a personâs name. However, behavioral targeting does create digital dossiers on consumers with the aim of connecting browsing activity to a tagged individual. This tagging is largely invisible to consumers, who are not asked to explicitly give consent for this practice. By using data collected clandestinely, behavioral targeting undermines the autonomy of consumers in their online shopping and purchase decisions. In order to illustrate the nature of consumer tracking, a case study was conducted that examined behavioral targeting within Levis.com, the e-commerce site for the Levis clothing line. The results show the Levis web site loads a total of nine tracking tags that link to eight third party companies, none of which are acknowledged in the Levis privacy policy. Behavioral targeting, by camouflaging the tracking of consumers, can damage the perceived trustworthiness of an e-commerce site or the actor it represents. The risks behavioral targeting presents to trust within e-commerce are discussed, leading to recommendations to reestablish consumer control over behavioral targeting methods.},

While Facebook is particularly focused on facilitating personal self-presentation, LinkedIn's interface caters towards the need for professional self-promotion. And yet, both platforms deploy similar principles of connectivity and narrative - strategies that can be succinctly revealed in recent interface changes. These changing digital architectures form the necessary backdrop for asking critical questions about online self-presentation: How are public identities shaped through platform interfaces?

The business model of gathering, producing and distributing news changed rapidly. Producing content is not enough; moderation and curation are at least as important when it comes to working for digital platforms. There is a growing pressure on news organizations to produce more inexpensive content for digital platforms, resulting in new models of low-cost or even free content production. Aggregation, either by humans or machines 'finding' news and re-publishing it, is gaining importance. At so-called 'content farms' freelancers, part-timers and amateurs produce articles that are expected to end up high in web searches. Apart from this low-pay model a no-pay model emerged were bloggers write for no compensation at all. At the Huffington Post thousands of bloggers actually work for free. Other websites use similar models, sometimes offering writers a fixed price depending on the number of clicks a page gets. We analyse the background, the consequences for journalists and journalism and the implications for online news organizations.

abstract = {Emerging across many disciplines are questions about algorithmic ethics â about the values embedded in artificial intelligence and big data analytics that increasingly replace human decisionmaking. Many are concerned that an algorithmic society is too opaque to be accountable for its behavior. An individual can be denied parole or denied credit, fired or not hired for reasons she will never know and cannot be articulated. In the public sector, the opacity of algorithmic decisionmaking is particularly problematic both because governmental decisions may be especially weighty, and because democratically-elected governments bear special duties of accountability. Investigative journalists have recently exposed the dangerous impenetrability of algorithmic processes used in the criminal justice field â dangerous because the predictions they make can be both erroneous and unfair, with none the wiser. We set out to test the limits of transparency around governmental deployment of big data analytics, focusing our investigation on local and state government use of predictive algorithms. It is here, in local government, that algorithmically-determined decisions can be most directly impactful. And it is here that stretched agencies are most likely to hand over the analytics to private vendors, which may make design and policy choices out of the sight of the client agencies, the public, or both. To see just how impenetrable the resulting âblack boxâ algorithms are, we filed 42 open records requests in 23 states seeking essential information about six predictive algorithm programs. We selected the most widely-used and well-reviewed programs, including those developed by for-profit companies, nonprofits, and academic/private sector partnerships. The goal was to see if, using the open records process, we could discover what policy judgments these algorithms embody, and could evaluate their utility and fairness. To do this work, we identified what meaningful âalgorithmic transparencyâ entails. We found that in almost every case, it wasn't provided. Over-broad assertions of trade secrecy were a problem. But contrary to conventional wisdom, they were not the biggest obstacle. It will not usually be necessary to release the code used to execute predictive models in order to dramatically increase transparency. We conclude that publicly-deployed algorithms will be sufficiently transparent only if (1) governments generate appropriate records about their objectives for algorithmic processes and subsequent implementation and validation; (2) government contractors reveal to the public agency sufficient information about how they developed the algorithm; and (3) public agencies and courts treat trade secrecy claims as the limited exception to public disclosure that the law requires. Although it would require a multi-stakeholder process to develop best practices for record generation and disclosure, we present what we believe are eight principal types of information that such records should ideally contain.},

abstract = {Advertisers are demanding more accurate estimates of the impact of targeted advertisements, yet no study proposes an appropriate methodology to analyze the effectiveness of a targeted advertising campaign, and there is a dearth of empirical evidence on the effectiveness of targeted advertising as a whole. The targeted population is more likely to convert from advertising so the response lift between the targeted and untargeted group to the advertising is likely an overestimate of the impact of targeted advertising. We propose a difference-indifferences estimator to account for this selection bias by decomposing the impact of targeting into selection bias and treatment effects components. Using several large-scale online advertising campaigns, we test the effectiveness of targeted advertising on brand-related searches and clickthrough rates. We find that the treatment effect on the targeted group is about twice as large for brand-related searches, but naively estimating this effect without taking into account selection bias leads to an overestima-tion of the lift from targeting on brand-related searches by almost 1,000{\%}.},

'Platform' has been deployed in both their populist appeals and their marketing pitches-sometimes as technical platforms, sometimes as platforms from which to speak, sometimes as platforms of opportunity. Whatever tensions exist in serving all of these constituencies are carefully elided. The term also fits their efforts to shape information policy, where they seek protection for facilitating user expression, yet also seek limited liability for what those users say.

abstract = {Human behaviour is thought to spread through face-to-face social networks, but it is difficult to identify social influence effects in observational studies, and it is unknown whether online social networks operate in the same way. Here we report results from a randomized controlled trial of political mobilization messages delivered to 61 million Facebook users during the 2010 US congressional elections. The results show that the messages directly influenced political self-expression, information seeking and real-world voting behaviour of millions of people. Furthermore, the messages not only influenced the users who received them but also the users' friends, and friends of friends. The effect of social transmission on real-world voting was greater than the direct effect of the messages themselves, and nearly all the transmission occurred between 'close friends' who were more likely to have a face-to-face relationship. These results suggest that strong ties are instrumental for spreading both online and real-world behaviour in human social networks.},

@article{Golden-Biddle1993,
abstract = {This paper examines iiow written research accounts based on ethnography appeal to readers to find them convincing. In particular, it highlights the role of rhetoric in the readers' interaction with and interpretation of the accounts. Extending relevant work in the litera-tures of organization studies, anthropology and literary criticism, the paper develops three dimensionsâauthenticity, plausibility and criticalityâcentral to the process of convincing. Further, through the analysis of a sample of ethnographic articles, it discloses the particular writing practices and more general strategies that make claims on readers to engage the texts and to accept that these three dimensions have been achieved. Through authenticity, ethnographic texts appeal to readers to accept that the researcher was indeed present in the field and grasped how the members understood their world. Strategies to achieve authenticity include: particularizing everyday life, delineating the relationship between the researcher and organization members, depicting the disciplined pursuit and analysis of data, and qualifying personal biases. Through plausibility, ethnographic texts make claims on readers to accept that the findings make a distinctive contribution to issues of common concern. Plausibility is accomplished by strategies that normalize unorthodox methodologies, recruit the reader, legitimate atypical situations, smooth contestable assertions, build dramatic anticipation, and differentiate the findings. Finally, through criticality, ethnographic texts endeavor to probe readers to re-examine the taken-for-granted assumptions that underly their work. Strategies to achieve criticality include: carving out room to reflect, provoking the recognition and examination of differences, and enabling readers to imagine new possibilities. The empirical analyses, which highlight both the rhetorical and substantive aspects of convincing, suggest that at a minimum ethnographic texts must achieve both authenticity and plausibilityâthat is, they must convey the vitality and uniqueness of the field situation and also build their case for the particular contribution of the findings to a disciplinary area of common interest. These analyses also suggest that the most provocative task and promising potential of ethnography is the use of richly-grounded data to not only refiect on the members' world, but more importantly to provoke an examination of the readers' prevailing assumptions and beliefs, (CONVINCING; QUALITATIVE RESEARCH; RHETORIC INTERPRETIVE PER-SPECTIVE; ETHNOGRAPHY) As in the social sciences generally, in the field of organization studies, accepted standards and practices exist for writing and for assessing the convincingness of written work which falls within the purview of normal science; that is work which adopts the positivist perspective and employs quantitative methodology (cf. Campbell and Stanley 1963, Cook and Campbell 1979, Kerlinger 1973). Some researchers using qualitative data have integrated their work into this perspective and have adopted these generally-accepted standards and practices. Specifically, they argue that qualita-tive data can be "triangulated" with quantitative data (Jick 1984, Mintzberg 1979) in order to generate theory which can later be tested more rigorously by quantitative approaches. However, when the interpretive perspective of science is adopted, as in much of the work based on ethnography, the generally-accepted standards and practices for writing and assessing the convincingness of this work become increas-ingly difficult to apply. â¢ Accepted by Richard L, Daft; received June 1990, This paper has been with the authors for two revisions,},

abstract = {This article argues that because the home is so familiar, it is necessary to make it strange, or defa- miliarize it, in order to open its design space. Critical approaches to technology design are of both practical and social importance in the home. Home appliances are loaded with cultural associations such as the gendered division of domestic labor that are easy to overlook. Further, homes are not the same everywhereâeven within a country. Peoples' aspirations and desires differ greatly across and between cultures. The target of western domestic technology design is often not the user, but the consumer.Web refrigerators that create shopping lists, garbage cans that let advertisers know what is thrown away, cabinets that monitor their contents and order more when supplies are low are central to current images of the wireless, digital home of the future. Drawing from our research in the United States, the United Kingdom, and Asia, we provide three different narratives of de- familiarization. A historical reading of American kitchens provides a lens with which to scrutinize new technologies of domesticity, an ethnographic account of an extended social unit in England problematizes taken-for-granted domestic technologies, and a comparative ethnography of the role of information and communication technologies in the daily lives of urban Asia's middle classes reveals the ways in which new technologies can be captured and domesticated in unexpected ways. In the final section of the article,we build on these moments of defamiliarization to suggest a broad set of challenges and strategies for design in the home.},

The intent here is not to demonize algorithms, but to recognize that they operate with biases like the rest of us.And they can make mistakes. What we generally lack as a public is clarity about how algorithms exercise their power over us. With that clarity comes an increased ability to publicly debate and dialogue the merits of any particular algorithmic power. While legal codes are available for us to read, algorithmic codes are more opaque, hidden behind layers of technical complexity. How can we characterize the power that various algorithms may exert on us? And how can we better understand when algorithms might be wronging us? What should be the role of journalists in holding that power to account? In the next section I discuss what algorithms are and how they encode power. I then describe the idea of algorithmic accountability, first examining how algorithms problematize and sometimes stand in tension with transparency. Next, I describe how reverse engineering can provide an alternative way to characterize algorithmic power by delineating a conceptual model that captures different investigative scenarios based on reverse engineering algorithms' input-output relationships. I then provide a number of illustrative cases and methodological details on how algorithmic accountability reporting might be realized in practice. I conclude with a discussion about broader issues of human resources, legality, ethics, and transparency.},

abstract = {The tendency towards an increasing integration of the informational web into our daily physical world (in particular in so-called Ambient Intelligent technologies which combine ideas derived from the field of Ubiquitous Computing, Intelligent User Interfaces and Ubiquitous Communication) is likely to make the development of successful profiling and personalization algorithms, like the ones currently used by internet companies such as Amazon , even more important than it is today. I argue that the way in which we experience ourselves necessarily goes through a moment of technical mediation. Because of this algorithmic profiling that thrives on continuous reconfiguration of identification should not be understood as a supplementary process which maps a pre-established identity that exists independently from the profiling practice. In order to clarify how the experience of one's identity can become affected by such machine-profiling a theoretical exploration of identity is made (including Agamben's understanding of an apparatus , Ricoeur's distinction between idem - and ipse -identity, and Stiegler's notion of a conjunctiveâdisjunctive relationship towards retentional apparatuses ). Although it is clear that no specific predictions about the impact of Ambient Intelligent technologies can be made without taking more particulars into account, the theoretical concepts are used to describe three general scenarios about the way wherein the experience of identity might become affected. To conclude, I argue that the experience of one's identity may affect whether the cases of unwarranted discrimination resulting from ubiquitous differentiations and identifications within an Ambient Intelligent environment, will become a matter of societal concern.},

abstract = {User resistance to information systems implementation has been identified as a salient reason for the failure of new systems and hence needs to be understood and managed. While previous research has explored the reasons for user resistance, there are gaps in our understanding of how users evaluate change related to a new information system and decide to resist it. In particular, missing in the explanation of user decision making is the concept of status quo bias, that is, that user resistance can be due to the bias or preference to stay with the current situation. Motivated thus, this study develops a model to explain user resistance prior to a new IS implementation by integrating the technology acceptance and resistance literatures with the status quo bias perspective. The results of testing the model in the context of a new enterprise system implementation indicate the central role of switching costs in increasing user resistance. Further, switching costs also mediate the relationship between other antecedents (colleague opinion and self-efficacy for change) and user resistance. Additionally, perceived value and organizational support for change are found to reduce user resistance. This research advances the theoretical understanding of user acceptance and resistance prior to a new IS implementation and offers organizations suggestions for managing such resistance.

abstract = {Widely reported privacy issues concerning major online advertising platforms (e.g., Facebook) have heightened concerns among users about the data that is collected about them. However, while we have a comprehensive understanding who collects data on users, as well as how tracking is implemented, there is still a significant gap in our understanding: what information do advertisers actually infer about users, and is this information accurate? In this study, we leverage Ad Preference Managers (APMs) as a lens through which to address this gap. APMs are transparency tools offered by some advertising platforms that allow users to see the interest profiles that are constructed about them. We recruited 220 participants to install an IRB approved browser extension that collected their interest profiles from four APMs (Google, Facebook, Oracle BlueKai, and Neilsen eXelate), as well as behavioral and survey data. We use this data to analyze the size and correctness of interest profiles, compare their composition across the four platforms, and investigate the origins of the data underlying these profiles.},

abstract = {We present the first longitudinal evidence that declining local political news coverage is reducing citizen engagement. Drawing on a content analysis of more than 10,000 stories about US House campaigns in 2010 and 2014, we show that local newspapers over this period published less, and less substantive, political news. We then use panel data from the Cooperative Congressional Election Study to investigate how the news environment influences citizen engagement. Tracking the same individuals over time and simultaneously measuring changes in media content in their communities reveals that reductions in citizens' political knowledge and participation follow declines in coverage about congressional elections. To the extent that the local news environment continues to deteriorate-a likely scenario as the industry continues to struggle-observers' concerns about political engagement in localities across the United States appear very much justified.},

abstract = {This study uses meme templates as a lens for exploring cultural globalization. By conceptualizing such templates as expressive repertoires that simultaneously enable and limit expression, we examined global and local dimensions of mainstream meme culture. We traced the top 100 templates in meme generators in English, German, Spanish, and Chinese, using 10 examples to typify each (n = 4000). Combining quantitative and qualitative analysis, we examined the forms, social identities, and emotions embedded in these templates. Our findings demonstrated that whereas meme templates are dominated by American/Western pop culture, local templates are also evident, especially in Chinese. Overall, memes are socially conservative yet emotionally disruptive; while they align with hegemonic representation patterns, their emotional palette tilts toward the negative, with anger as a major anchor and happiness expressed ironically. Finally, our findings suggested an individualismâcollectivism puzzle, wherein emotions in memes seem to contradict the existing literature on cultural values. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

abstract = {This article provides a history of private sector tracking technologies, examining how the advent of commercial surveillance centered around a logic of data capitalism. Data capitalism is a system in which the commoditization of our data enables an asymmetric redistribution of power that is weighted toward the actors who have access and the capability to make sense of information. It is enacted through capitalism and justified by the association of networked technologies with the political and social benefits of online community, drawing upon narratives that foreground the social and political benefits of networked technologies. I examine its origins in the wake of the dotcom bubble, when technology makers sought to develop a new business model to support online commerce. By leveraging user data for advertising purposes, they contributed to an information environment in which every action leaves behind traces collected by companies for commercial purposes. Through analysis of primary source materials produced by technology makers, journalists, and business analysts, I examine the emergence of data capitalism between the mid-1990s and mid-2000s and its central role in the contemporary information economy.},

abstract = {James Rachels' seminal paper âWhy Privacy Is Importantâ (1975) remains one of the most influential statements on the topic. It offers a general theory that explains why privacy is important in relation to mundane personal information and situations. According to the theory, privacy is important because it allows us to selectively disclose personal information and to engage in behaviors appropriate to and necessary for creating and maintaining diverse personal relationships. Without this control, it is implied, the diversity of relationships would diminish; relationships would âflatten outâ, we might say. The aspect of the paper that addresses information flows (what I refer to as his information privacy theory) has been of particular interest to computer information privacy theorists. Despite its continued importance to computer privacy theorists, however, the information privacy theory appears to be contradicted by recent developments in computing. In particular, since the publication of Rachels' paper we have seen an extensive amount of personal information collected. Further, recent developments in computing falling under the heading of social computing have brought about a new wave of personal information creation and collection. This paper will reassess and resituate Rachels' information privacy theory in light of these developments. I will argue that the increasing collection of personal data will not flatten relationships as the information privacy theory predicts because such data lack contextual factors important to Rachels' general theory. The paper will conclude by pointing to some areas where Rachels' general theory and where his information privacy theory will continue to be relevant.},

abstract = {Data brokers such as Acxiom and Experian are in the business of collecting and selling data on people; the data they sell is commonly used to feed marketing as well as political campaigns. Despite the ongoing privacy debate, there is still very limited visibility into data collection by data brokers. Recently, however, online advertising services such as Facebook have begun to partner with data brokers-to add additional targeting features to their platform-providing avenues to gain insight into data broker information. In this paper, we leverage the Facebook advertising system-and their partnership with six data brokers across seven countries-in order to gain insight into the extent and accuracy of data collection by data brokers today. We find that a surprisingly large percentage of Facebook accounts (e.g., above 90{\%} in the U.S.) are successfully linked to data broker information. Moreover, by running controlled ads to 183 crowdsourced U.S.-based volunteers, we find that at least 40{\%} of data broker sourced user attributes are not at all accurate, that users can have widely varying fractions of inaccurate attributes, and that even important information such as financial information can have a high degree of inaccuracy. Overall, this paper provides the first fine-grained look into the extent and accuracy of data collection by offline data brokers, helping to inform the ongoing privacy debate.},

These seminal documents are meant to provide discipline-specific guidance for research design and implementation and are regarded as key references when conducting research online. Our analysis revealed that the principles of respect and beneficence were explicitly conveyed in the documents analysed, offering nuanced interpretations on issues of informed consent, privacy, and benefits and risks as well as providing recommendations for modifying traditional practices to fit the online setting. However, the invocations of the principle of justice were rather implicit and reflect an important shift from the Belmont Report's protectionist ethical position towards more situational and dialogic approaches. With the rapidly evolving nature of internet technologies, this analysis is projected to contribute to the ongoing developments in research ethics in the social sciences by outlining the tensions and implications of the use of the internet as a methodological tool. We also seek to provide recommendations on how disciplinary associations can proceed to facilitate ethically sensitive internet research.},

abstract = {Time is of utmost importance in the writings of George Herbert Mead, the American pragmatist philosopher and social psychologist. Yet, despite Mead's prominence as the primary source of the symbolic interactionist approach to sociology, most social scientists are unfamiliar with his perspective on temporality. We describe his analysis of the present, the past, and the future-emphasizing that, for Mead, people live in the present, and that their interpretations of the past and the future are shaped by the present. In addition, we consider the implications of his perspective for our understanding of the self, interaction, and society. KEY WORDS â¢ agency â¢ determinism â¢ interaction â¢ self â¢ temporality It was time that stood between George Herbert Mead and his sought-after breakthrough in social psychology-the taken-for-granted time of everyday life and the nascent behavioral sciences of his era, where it was assumed that the past determines the future. Seeking to circumvent what he viewed as naive forms of determinism, he made time a central and explicit issue in his writings. Indeed, for Mead (1938: 64), more than any other social theorist, we inhabit a 'temporal world.' His own life was characterized by a busy simultaneity. Mead (1863-1931) was a leading pragmatist philosopher, the primary source of the symbolic inter-actionist perspective in sociology, a political progressive, and a central figure in the Chicago school of sociology. Drawing from the work of his friends and colleagues, William James and John Dewey, all of Mead's lectures and writings are grounded in the power of temporal organization for the creation of social order-especially the partitioning of time into present, past, and future.},

Realtime crowds enable crowd-powered systems that respond at interactive speeds: for example, cameras, robots and instant opinion polls. So far, these techniques have mainly been proof-of-concept prototypes: research has not yet attempted to understand how they might work at large scale or optimize their cost/performance trade-offs. In this paper, we use queueing theory to analyze the retainer model for realtime crowdsourcing, in particular its expected wait time and cost to requesters. We provide an algorithm that allows requesters to minimize their cost subject to performance requirements. We then propose and analyze three techniques to improve performance: push notifications, shared retainer pools, and precruitment, which involves recalling retainer workers before a task actually arrives. An experimental validation finds that precruited workers begin a task 500 milliseconds after it is posted, delivering results below the one-second cognitive threshold for an end-user to stay in flow.},

This article examines nearly 500 print media stories in order to make sense of the shifting dialogue around push-button warfare both in times of tumult and relative calm. The longitudinal study investigates how reporters frame predictions, prophecies, forecasts and expectations when trying to assess future technologies for war and peace.},

abstract = {What kind of news time does a public need? The production, circulation, and interpretation of news have always followed timelines and rhythms, but these have largely been seen as arti-facts of press sociology, not central aspects of journalism's public mission linked to the design and deployment of journalism infrastructure. Since different types of news time make possible different kinds of publics, any critique of the press's material cultures of time-keeping is a critique of the press's power to convene particular people and issues, at particular times. Moti-vated by the temporal needs of one type of public (a pragmatic public that ensures a public right to hear), this paper proposes a unit for studying news time (the temporal assemblage), and traces it across four intertwined sites in the contemporary, networked press: labor routines, platform rhythms, computational algorithms, and legal regulations. Beyond this article's inves-tigation of this public in relation to these dynamics, my aim is to contribute to the emerging " slow journalism " movement by asking: how slowâor fastâdo different publics need news to be? And how are networked press paces set?},

We analyze results of a measurement campaign to improve on the understanding of indoor GPS reception characteristics. The results show that using state-of-the-art receivers GPS availability is good in many buildings with standard material walls and roofs. The measured root mean squared 2D positioning error was below five meters in wooden buildings and below ten meters in most of the investigated brick and concrete buildings. Lower accuracies, where observed, can be linked to either low signal-to-noise ratios, multipath phenomena or bad satellite constellation geometry. We have also measured the indoor performance of embedded GPS receivers in mobile phones which provided lower availability and accuracy than state-of-the-art ones. Finally, we consider how the GPS performance within a given building is dependent on local properties like close-by building elements and materials, number of walls, number of overlaying stories and surrounding buildings.},

To improve transparency, some companies are allowing users to access their behavioral profiles. In this work, we investigated behavioral profiles of users by utilizing these access mechanisms. Using in-person interviews (n=8), we analyzed the data shown in the profiles, elicited user concerns, and estimated accuracy of profiles. We confirmed our interview findings via an online survey (n=100). To assess the claim of improving transparency, we compared data shown in profiles with the data that companies have about users. More than 70{\%} of the participants expressed concerns about collection of sensitive data such as credit and health information, level of detail and how their data may be used. We found a large gap between the data shown in profiles and the data possessed by companies. A large number of profiles were inaccurate with as much as 80{\%} inaccuracy.

In this paper, we present GeoSR, the first adaptation of SR methods to the context of geographic data exploration. By combining the first use of a knowledge repository structure that is replete with non-classical relations, a new means of explaining those relations to users, and the novel application of SR measures to a geographic reference system, GeoSR allows users to geographically navigate and investigate the world knowledge encoded in Wikipedia. There are numerous visualization and interaction paradigms possible with GeoSR; we present one implementation as a proof-of-concept and discuss others. Although, Wikipedia is used as the knowledge repository for our implementation, GeoSR will also work with any knowledge repository having a similar set of properties.},

abstract = {Mobile users face privacy risks when providing their locations to untrusted location based services (LBSs). We develop CacheCloak, a system that enables realtime anonymization of location data. A trusted anonymizing server receives the location of a user, processes it using CacheCloak, and exposes the processed data to LBSs. We show that the quality of the location data does not degrade in space or time, and hence, LBSs are able to respond accurately in real time. Yet, privacy is preserved as LBSs are unable to track any given user for more than a short duration. The key is to exploit mobility patterns to intelligently extrapolate each user's path until it meets another. A snapshot of intersecting paths is sent to the LBS, preventing reliable tracking of any given user. We use stochastic methods to generate mobility predictions and entropy measurements to quantify a user's anonymity. We demonstrate a high tracking resilience against a reasonably powerful adversary. Trace-based traffic simulation using real GIS data shows that CacheCloak can achieve realtime location privacy without degrading location accuracy or service availability.},

We evaluate 3 commercial gender classification systems using our dataset and show that darker-skinned females are the most misclassified group (with error rates of up to 34.7{\%}). The maximum error rate for lighter-skinned males is 0.8{\%}. The substantial disparities in the accuracy of classifying darker females, lighter females, darker males, and lighter males in gender classification systems require urgent attention if commercial companies are to build genuinely fair, transparent and accountable facial analysis algorithms.},

However, it has been noted that the products offered on recommendation lists are often too similar to each other and attention has been paid towards the goal of improving diversity to avoid monotonous recommendations. Noting that the retrieval of a set of items matching a user query is a common problem across many applications of information retrieval, we model the competing goals of maximizing the diversity of the retrieved list while maintaining adequate similarity to the user query as a binary optimization problem. We explore a solution strategy to this optimization problem by relaxing it to a trust-region problem.This leads to a parameterized eigenvalue problem whose solution is finally quantized to the required binary solution. We apply this approach to the top-N prediction problem, evaluate the system performance on the Movielens dataset and compare it with a standard item-based top-N algorithm.

abstract = {The study of digital media and political action must consider variations in media ecologies to account for the ways in which contextually specific circumstances influence the character of local democratic participation. This article argues for this need by synthesising the disconnected literatures on Australian communications infrastructures, municipal governments and local news media. It reveals uneven levels of connectivity, restricted digital government practices and a decreasing capacity of local newsrooms and journalists to cover local politics. These problems coalesce to create risks of ill-informed citizenries, illegitimate local decision making and minimally accountable local governments.

abstract = {We summarize the potential impact that the European Union's new General Data Protection Regulation will have on the routine use of machine learning algorithms. Slated to take effect as law across the EU in 2018, it will restrict automated individual decision-making (that is, algorithms that make decisions based on user-level predictors) which "significantly affect" users. The law will also effectively create a "right to explanation," whereby a user can ask for an explanation of an algorithmic decision that was made about them. We argue that while this law will pose large challenges for industry, it highlights opportunities for computer scientists to take the lead in designing algorithms and evaluation frameworks which avoid discrimination and enable explanation.},

abstract = {Calls for heightened consideration of fairness and accountability in algorithmically-informed public decisions-like taxation , justice, and child protection-are now commonplace. How might designers support such human values? We interviewed 27 public sector machine learning practitioners across 5 OECD countries regarding challenges understanding and imbuing public values into their work. The results suggest a disconnect between organisational and institutional realities, constraints and needs, and those addressed by current research into usable, transparent and 'discrimination-aware' machine learning-absences likely to undermine practical initiatives unless addressed. We see design opportunities in this disconnect, such as in supporting the tracking of concept drift in secondary data sources, and in building usable transparency tools to identify risks and incorporate domain knowledge, aimed both at managers and at the 'street-level bureaucrats' on the frontlines of public service. We conclude by outlining ethical challenges and future directions for collaboration in these high-stakes applications.},

abstract = {Over the past decade, advertising has emerged as the primary source of revenue for many web sites and apps. In this paper we report a first-of-its-kind study that seeks to broadly understand the features, mechanisms and dynamics of display advertising on the web - i.e., the Adscape. Our study takes the perspective of users who are the targets of display ads shown on web sites. We develop a scalable crawling capability that enables us to gather the details of display ads including creatives and landing pages. Our crawling strategy is focused on maximizing the number of unique ads harvested. Of critical importance to our study is the recognition that a user's profile (i.e. browser profile and cookies) can have a significant impact on which ads are shown. We deploy our crawler over a variety of websites and profiles and this yields over 175K distinct display ads. We find that while targeting is widely used, there remain many instances in which delivered ads do not depend on user profile; further, ads vary more over user profiles than over websites. We also assess the population of advertisers seen and identify over 3.7K distinct entities from a variety of business segments. Finally, we find that when targeting is used, the specific types of ads delivered generally correspond with the details of user profiles, and also on users' patterns of visit.},

abstract = {Every day automated algorithms make decisions that can amplify the power of businesses and governments. Yet as algorithms come to regulate more aspects of our lives, the contours of their power can remain difficult to grasp. This paper studies the notion of algorithmic account- ability reporting as a mechanism for elucidating and articulating the power structures, biases, and influences that computational artifacts exercise in society. A framework for algorithmic power based on autonomous decision-making is proffered and motivates specific questions about algorithmic influence. Five cases of algorithmic accountability reporting involving the use of reverse engineering methods in journalism are then studied and analyzed to provide insight into the method and its application in a journalism context. The applicability of trans- parency policies for algorithms is discussed alongside challenges to implementing algorithmic accountability as a broadly viable investigative method.},

abstract = {In September 2010, a video titled "It Gets Better" was uploaded to YouTube, responding to suicides of gay teens who had suffered from homophobic bullying. Before long, thousands of Internet users added their own versions of the clip, creating a mass appeal to young people while simultaneously negotiating the norms of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer (LGBTQ) collective identity. Conceptualizing this body of videos as an Internet meme, we examine the extent to which participants imitate or alter textual components presented in previous videos. A combined quantitative and qualitative analysis of 200 clips shows that in an arena ostensibly free of formal gatekeepers, participants tend to police themselves, toeing the line with conformist norms. We also identify domains of potential subversion, related not only to the content of the videos but mainly to the forms facilitated by digital media.},

A rhetorical analysis of nearly 50 mission statements and ethnographic work on two case studies revealed a commitment to rebuilding public trust, to reclaiming community journalism, to re-emphasizing the "ordinary" citizen, and to pioneering collaborative news work by means of digital technologies. Our analysis demonstrated that many of these organizations, in considering news as a public good, work to re-conceptualize the industry for citizens, but depend upon a level of funding that might not be viable in the long term. However, this research posits that little in the way of true community trust can be achieved until these organizations discover a sustainable business model.},

abstract = {Various survey studies document that net present value (NPV) method is very popular and widely used by firms in capital budgeting in practice. The main disadvantage of NPV approach is that it lacks of flexibility and the firm needs to make the decision today in spite of uncertain factors the project faces in the future. The way to address such deficiency is to incorporate real options tool to supplement NPV criterion. Although survey literatures indicate that firms seldom use real options method in capital budgeting due to lack of knowledge/skill and lack of support of top executives, we can foresee that using real options technique to supplement NPV method in capital budgeting will be the future trend. In finance education, to assist future executives be on the right track for the future trend, real options approach, along with other advanced techniques such as simulation and binominal lattices should be taught and emphasized in MBA-level (or advanced undergraduate-level) corporate finance courses.},

abstract = {Twitter has evolved from being a conversation or opinion sharing medium among friends into a platform to share and disseminate information about current events. Events in the real world create a corresponding spur of posts (tweets) on Twitter. Not all content posted on Twitter is trustworthy or useful in providing information about the event. In this paper, we analyzed the credibility of information in tweets corresponding to fourteen high impact news events of 2011 around the globe. From the data we analyzed, on average 30{\%} of total tweets posted about an event contained situational information about the event while 14{\%} was spam. Only 17{\%} of the total tweets posted about the event contained situational awareness information that was credible. Using regression analysis, we identified the important content and sourced based features, which can predict the credibility of information in a tweet. Prominent content based features were number of unique characters, swear words, pronouns, and emoticons in a tweet, and user based features like the number of followers and length of username. We adopted a supervised machine learning and relevance feedback approach using the above features, to rank tweets according to their credibility score. The performance of our ranking algorithm significantly enhanced when we applied re-ranking strategy. Results show that extraction of credible information from Twitter can be automated with high confidence.},

The results show that, collectively, audiences believe algorithmic selection guided by a user's past consumption behaviour is a better way to get news than editorial curation. There are, however, significant variations in these beliefs at the individual level.

Our original content analysis of newspaper coverage in every U.S. House district during the 2010 midterms reveals that districts with uncompetitive races and those served by large-circulation outlets see significantly less, and less substantive, coverage than hotly contested districts and those served by smaller outlets. We then merge the news data with survey data from the 2010 CCES and find that a diminished news environment depresses citizen engagement. Citizens exposed to a lower volume of coverage are less able to evaluate their member of Congress, less likely to express opinions about the House candidates in their districts, and less likely to vote. This is true for people regardless of levels of political awareness, indicating that the deleterious consequences of a decline in local coverage are widespread, not restricted to the least attentive citizens.},

abstract = {Telecommunications services are for long subject to privacy regulations. At stake are traditionally: privacy of the communication and the protection of traffic data. Privacy of the communication is legally founded. Traffic data subsume under the notion of data protection and are central in the discussion. The telecommunications environment is profoundly changing. The traditionally closed markets with closed networks change into an open market with open networks. Within these open networks more privacy sensitive data are generated and have to be exchanged between growing numbers of parties. Also telecommunications and computer networks are rapidly being integrated and thus the distinction between telephony and computing disappears. Traditional telecommunications privacy regulations are revised to cover internet applications. In this paper telecommunications issues are recalled to aid the on-going debate. Cellular mobile phones have recently be introduced. Cellular networks process a particular category of traffic data namely location data, thereby introducing the issue of territorial privacy into the telecommunications domain. Location data are bound to be used for pervasive future services. Designs for future services are discussed and evaluated for their impact on privacy protection.},

abstract = {A growing number of people are working as part of on-line crowd work. Crowd work is often thought to be low wage work. However, we know little about the wage distribution in practice and what causes low/high earnings in this setting. We recorded 2,676 workers performing 3.8 million tasks on Amazon Mechanical Turk. Our task-level analysis revealed that workers earned a median hourly wage of only {\~{}}{\$}2/h, and only 4{\%} earned more than {\$}7.25/h. While the average requester pays more than {\$}11/h, lower-paying requesters post much more work. Our wage calculations are influenced by how unpaid work is accounted for, e.g., time spent searching for tasks, working on tasks that are rejected, and working on tasks that are ultimately not submitted. We further explore the characteristics of tasks and working patterns that yield higher hourly wages. Our analysis informs platform design and worker tools to create a more positive future for crowd work},

A central feature of this website is the dazzling number of derivative videos, uploaded daily by many thousands. Using the âmeme' concept as an analytic tool, this article aims at uncovering the attributes common to âmemetic videos' â popular clips that generate extensive user engagement by way of creative derivatives. Drawing on YouTube popularity-measurements and on user-generated playlists, a corpus of 30 prominent memetic videos was assembled. A combined qualitative and quantitative analysis of these videos yielded six common features: focus on ordinary people, flawed masculinity, humor, simplicity, repetitiveness and whimsical content. Each of these attributes marks the video as incomplete or flawed, thereby invoking further creative dialogue. In its concluding section, the article addresses the skyrocketing popularity of mimicking in contemporary digital culture, linking it to economic, social and cultural logics of participation.},

Of special interest are Denver and Seattle, where the Rocky Mountain News and Seattle Post-Intelligencer closed during the intervening year. The data from the CPS indicate that civic engage-ment in Seattle and Denver dropped significantly from 2008 to 2009âa decline that is not consistently replicated over the same time period in other major American cities that did not lose a newspaper. The analysis suggests that this decline may plausibly be attributed to the newspaper closures in Seattle and Denver. This short-term negative effect is concerning, and whether it lasts warrants future attention.},

abstract = {Some fear that personalised communication can lead to information cocoons or filter bubbles. For instance, a personalised news website could give more prominence to conservative or liberal media items, based on the (assumed) political interests of the user. As a result, users may encounter only a limited range of political ideas. We synthesise empirical research on the extent and effects of self-selected personalisation, where people actively choose which content they receive, and pre-selected personalisation, where algorithms personalise content for users without any deliberate user choice. We conclude that â in spite of the serious concerns voiced â at present, there is no empirical evidence that warrants any strong worries about filter bubbles. Nevertheless, the debate about filter bubbles is important. Personalisation on news sites is still at an infant stage, and personalised content does not constitute a substantial information source for most citizens, as our review of literature on media use has shown. However, if personalisation technology improves, and personalised news content becomes people's main information source, problems for our democracy could indeed arise, as our review of empirical studies of media effects has shown.},

It is important to understand the potential privacy impacts when such personal data are commercialised, to ensure that expectations of privacy are preserved. This paper presents the first user study of incentivised location sharing, where people are given a direct monetary incentive to share their location with a business or their social network. We use Nis-senbaum's framework of contextual integrity in a preliminary user study (n=22) to investigate potential privacy risks with such services. We find that monetisation changes why people share their data, but not the frequency of disclosures. Our results motivate further study and are useful for designers of location-sharing systems and researchers who wish to leverage the diverse range of personal data that are available in a privacy-sensitive manner.},

abstract = {Awareness of bias in algorithms is growing among scholars and users of algorithmic systems. But what can we observe about how users discover and behave around such biases? We used a cross-platform audit technique that analyzed on-line ratings of 803 hotels across three hotel rating platforms and found that one site's algorithmic rating system biased ratings , particularly low-to-medium quality hotels, significantly higher than others (up to 37{\%}). Analyzing reviews of 162 users who independently discovered this bias, we seek to understand if, how, and in what ways users perceive and manage this bias. Users changed the typical ways they used a review on a hotel rating platform to instead discuss the rating system itself and raise other users' awareness of the rating bias. This raising of awareness included practices like efforts to reverse-engineer the rating algorithm, efforts to correct the bias, and demonstrations of broken trust. We conclude with a discussion of how such behavior patterns might inform design approaches that anticipate unexpected bias and provide reliable means for meaningful bias discovery and response.},

abstract = {Recently, online targeted advertising platforms like Facebook have been criticized for allowing advertisers to discriminate against users belonging to sensitive groups, i.e., to exclude users belonging to a certain race or gender from receiving their ads. Such criticisms have led, for instance, Facebook to disallow the use of attributes such as ethnic affinity from being used by advertisers when targeting ads related to housing or employment or financial services. In this paper, we show that such measures are far from sufficient and that the problem of discrimination in targeted advertising is much more pernicious. We argue that discrimination measures should be based on the targeted population and not on the attributes used for targeting. We systematically investigate the different targeting methods offered by Facebook for their ability to enable discriminatory advertising. We show that a malicious advertiser can create highly discriminatory ads without using sensitive attributes. Our findings call for exploring fundamentally new methods for mitigating discrimination in online targeted advertising.},

abstract = {Artificial intelligence and machine learning are in a period of astounding growth. However, there are concerns that these technologies may be used, either with or without intention, to perpetuate the prejudice and unfairness that unfortunately characterizes many human institutions. Here we show for the first time that human-like semantic biases result from the application of standard machine learning to ordinary language---the same sort of language humans are exposed to every day. We replicate a spectrum of standard human biases as exposed by the Implicit Association Test and other well-known psychological studies. We replicate these using a widely used, purely statistical machine-learning model---namely, the GloVe word embedding---trained on a corpus of text from the Web. Our results indicate that language itself contains recoverable and accurate imprints of our historic biases, whether these are morally neutral as towards insects or flowers, problematic as towards race or gender, or even simply veridical, reflecting the {\{}$\backslash$em status quo{\}} for the distribution of gender with respect to careers or first names. These regularities are captured by machine learning along with the rest of semantics. In addition to our empirical findings concerning language, we also contribute new methods for evaluating bias in text, the Word Embedding Association Test (WEAT) and the Word Embedding Factual Association Test (WEFAT). Our results have implications not only for AI and machine learning, but also for the fields of psychology, sociology, and human ethics, since they raise the possibility that mere exposure to everyday language can account for the biases we replicate here.},

Moreover, ranking algorithms of the conventional Web search engines are often based on relevance and popularity of Web pages. Towards credibility-oriented Web search, our proposed system provides users with the following three functions: (1) calculation and visualization of several scores of Web search results on the main credibility aspects, (2) prediction of user's credibility judgment model through user's credibility feedback for Web search results, and (3) re-ranking of Web search results based on user's predicted credibility model. Experimental results suggest that our system enables users - in particular, users with knowledge about search topics - to find credible Web pages from a list of Web search results more efficiently than conventional Web search interfaces.},

To answer this question, we interviewed re-searchers and observed them code interview transcripts. We found that across disciplines, researchers follow several cod-ing practices well-suited to automation. Further, researchers desire automation after having developed a codebook and coded a subset of data, particularly in extending their cod-ing to unseen data. Researchers also require any assistive tool to be transparent about its recommendations. Based on our findings, we built prototypes to partially automate coding using simple natural language processing techniques. Our top-performing system generates coding that matches human coders on inter-rater reliability measures.

@inproceedings{Zheng2010,
abstract = {With the increasing popularity of location-based services, such as tour guide and location-based social network, we now have accumulated many location data on the Web. In this paper, we show that, by using the location data based on GPS and users comments at various locations, we can discover interesting locations and possible activities that can be performed there for recommendations. Our research is highlighted in the following location-related queries in our daily life: 1) if we want to do something such as sightseeing or food-hunting in a large city such as Beijing, where should we go? 2) If we have already visited some places such as the Birds Nest building in Beijings Olympic park, what else can we do there? By using our system, for the first question, we can recommend her to visit a list of interesting locations such as Tiananmen Square, Birds Nest, etc. For the second question, if the user visits Birds Nest, we can recommend her to not only do sightseeing but also to experience its outdoor exercise facilities or try some nice food nearby. To achieve this goal, we first model the users location and activity histories that we take as input. We then mine knowledge, such as the location features and activity-activity correlations from the geographical databases and the Web, to gather additional inputs. Finally, we apply a collective matrix factorization method to mine interesting locations and activities, and use them to recommend to the users where they can visit if they want to perform some specific activities and what they can do if they visit some specific places. We empirically evaluated our system using a large GPS dataset collected by 162 users over a period of 2.5 years in the real-world. We extensively evaluated our system and showed that our system can outperform several state-of-the-art baselines.},

abstract = {Local news media in the United Kingdom are undergoing a multitude of changes which have implications for our understanding of their value in local democracies. Despite the potential significance of these changes for those actors responsible for the provision of local news, very little research has investigated journalists' and political communicators' perceptions of the impact of these threats and opportunities. This article addresses this gap by presenting research which investigated the views of key stakeholders in the production of local news in a large city in the United Kingdom. The thematic analysis of 14 interviews evaluates how normative roles attributed to journalism, such as representing the public, acting as a watchdog, providing information, and running campaigns, are being fulfilled by different news providers in the current news ecology.

@article{LaRose2010,
abstract = {To what extent is repeated media consumption behavior a matter of habit rather than continuing and active self-instruction? The physiological and cognitive origins of habits are examined in the context of current research in neurology and social psychology. The result is a reconceptualization of media habits along a continuum from consciously enacted behaviors to those that are activated automatically by external stimuli. Communication research perspectives of the role of habits in media consumption are critically reviewed. From this analysis, habits emerge as automatic thought processes that are powerful predictors of media behavior and a model of habitual media consumption is proposed. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

@book{Shifman2013,
abstract = {In December 2012, the exuberant video "Gangnam Style" became the first YouTube clip to be viewed more than one billion times. Thousands of its viewers responded by creating and posting their own variations of the video--"Mitt Romney Style," "NASA Johnson Style," "Egyptian Style," and many others. "Gangnam Style" (and its attendant parodies, imitations, and derivations) is one of the most famous examples of an Internet meme: a piece of digital content that spreads quickly around the web in various iterations and becomes a shared cultural experience. In this book, Limor Shifman investigates Internet memes and what they tell us about digital culture. Shifman discusses a series of well-known Internet memes -- including "Leave Britney Alone," the pepper-spraying cop, LOLCats, Scumbag Steve, and Occupy Wall Street's "We Are the 99 Percent." She offers a novel definition of Internet memes: digital content units with common characteristics, created with awareness of each other, and circulated, imitated, and transformed via the Internet by many users. She differentiates memes from virals; analyzes what makes memes and virals successful; describes popular meme genres; discusses memes as new modes of political participation in democratic and nondemocratic regimes; and examines memes as agents of globalization. Memes, Shifman argues, encapsulate some of the most fundamental aspects of the Internet in general and of the participatory Web 2.0 culture in particular. Internet memes may be entertaining, but in this book Limor Shifman makes a compelling argument for taking them seriously.},

Both of the revenue streams that local news organizations have traditionally relied upon (subscriptions and advertising) have been dramatically undermined as journalism production, distribution, and consumption have migrated online. And yet, while we know that local journalism is suffering, we know relatively little about whether all communities are being affected in the same way. ï® Are some types of communities suffering worse than others? ï® Are there particular characteristics of individual communities that are related to the state of their local journalism?},

@article{Dellarocas2016,
abstract = {N ews aggregators have emerged as an important component of digital content ecosystems, attracting traffic by hosting curated collections of links to third-party content, but also inciting conflict with content producers. Aggregators provide titles and short summaries (snippets) of articles they link to. Content producers claim that their presence deprives them of traffic that would otherwise flow to their sites. In light of this controversy, we conduct a series of field experiments whose objective is to provide insight with respect to how readers allocate their attention between a news aggregator and the original articles it links to. Our experiments are based on manipulating elements of the user interface of a Swiss mobile news aggregator. We examine how key design parameters, such as the length of the text snippet that an aggregator displays about articles, the presence of associated images, and the number of related articles on the same story, affect a reader's propensity to visit the content producer's site and read the full article. Our findings suggest the presence of a substitution relationship between the amount of information that aggregators offer about articles and the probability that readers will opt to read the full articles at the content producer sites. Interestingly, however, when several related article outlines compete for user attention, a longer snippet and the inclusion of an image increase the probability that an article will be chosen over its competitors.},

Volunteers apply by specifying the amount of compensation which they would require to participate in the experiment. The experimental subjects are led to believe that we will run a sealed-bid second-price auction on these values, and thus we obtain an estimate of the value that users attach to their location data being used by third parties.},
