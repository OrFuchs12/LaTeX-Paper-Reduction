  abstract =     "In this paper we discuss the optimizing compilation of
                 Constraint Handling Rules (CHRs). CHRs are a
                 multi-headed committed choice constraint language,
                 commonly applied for writing incremental constraint
                 solvers. CHRs are usually implemented as a language
                 extension that compiles to the underlying language. In
                 this paper we show how we can use different kinds of
                 information in the compilation of CHRs in order to
                 obtain access efficiency, and a better translation of
                 the CHR rules into the underlying language, which in
                 this case is HAL. The kinds of information used include
                 the types, modes, determinism, functional dependencies
                 and symmetries of the CHR constraints. We also show how
                 to analyze CHR programs to determine this information
                 about functional dependencies, symmetries and other
                 kinds of information supporting optimizations.",
