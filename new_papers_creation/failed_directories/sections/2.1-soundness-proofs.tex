In this section, we use a lemma from \citet{nilsson2000evaluating}, 
to prove the soundness of a criterion for value of information.

We will use some language for talking about policies across different graphs, %
consistent with the past usage of \citet{nilsson2000evaluating}.
First, if $\calM(\calG)$ is a CIM on a CID $\calG$, and $\calG'$ is like $\calG$ but missing some information links, then $\calM$ immediately also defines a CIM $\calM(\calG')$ on $\calG'$.
If $\pi'$ is a rule for $D$ in $\calM(\calG')$, then $\pi'$ can be typecast into a policy for $\calM(\calG)$ via $\pi'(\tilde\pa^D, \pa^D\setminus\tilde\pa^D, \eps^D) := \pi'(\tilde\pa^D, \eps^D)$, where $\tilde\Pa^D$ are the parents of $D$ in $\calG'$.
We will therefore allow ourselves to talk about policies for $\calM(\calG')$ as policies also for $\calM(\calG)$.

The result from \citet{nilsson2000evaluating} is as follows.

\input{theorems/nonrequisite-removal}

Intuitively, the proof (\citep[Theorem 3]{nilsson2000evaluating}) shows that performance is not decreased whenever a nonrequisite
link is removed, and induction is performed over successive $d$-reductions.

\begin{corollary}[VoI graphical criterion soundness] \label{le:materiality-soundness}
Let $\calG$ be a CID \withSR containing a decision $D \in \sD$ and chance node $X \in \Pa(D)$.
If the minimal d-reduction $\calG^*$ does not contain $X \to D$
then 
in every CIM $\calM$ compatible with $\calG$,
$X$ has positive VoI for $D$.
\end{corollary}

The result follows immediately from \cref{le:dred-performance}.
