Reviewer 1

- Would like to see optimistic results (Rick: Amusingly, we actually did include them, we just said we didn't in the text and nobody noticed)
- page 2: "to the nearest goal": a nearest goal (Rick: DONE)
- elaborate on heuristic consistency (Rick: We already did, so I decided not to)
- page 2: typo: "sate-space" (Rick: DONE)
- Remark on proof of Theorem 3. The paper proves a stronger condition than is needed for applying Theorem 2. Why? (Rick: I don't really understand the reviewer's problem here. It's an upper bound, that's what makes it an upper bound. I tried to fix it.)
- page 4: typo: "the fact that [...] ensure": ensures (Rick: DONE)
- page 5: equation 1: "Hamming" seems to be in math mode (Rick: Changed to H)



Reviewer 2

- Only concern is that the experiments only simulate errors and do not take into account real data (Rick: nothing we can really do about this)


Reviwer 3

- Runtimes seem unusually large when compared to other results in the literature (Rick: I assume this is because we didn't use the best PDBs)
- Did not compare against non-memory based heuristics (Rick: That's dumb ... I mean ... sigh ... I guess we can add something about how these are not intended to be the best heuristics, this is just for experimentation ... sigh).
- Introduction, second paragraph: The PDB is consulted for every generated node, not just those generated. (Rick: DONE)
- Fifth paragraph: "... which incur in additional..." -> remove in (Rick: DONE)
