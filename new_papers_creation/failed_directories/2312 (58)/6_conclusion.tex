\section{Conclusion}
In this paper, we have studied the problem of graph clustering via maximizing modularity. The existing techniques often require the number of clusters beforehand or they fail to capitalize on the potential benefits of associated node attributes and availability of supplementary information. To address these, we have introduced {\model}, a novel neural framework that works well without a predefined number of clusters. Moreover, our framework uses graph neural networks (GNNs) to leverage the node attributes and additional information present within the graph. The computational complexity of {\model} scales linearly with the graph size.
Through extensive experimentation across seven real-world datasets of varying sizes and employing multiple distinct cluster quality evaluation metrics, we have showcased the superior performance of {\model}: it consistently has outperformed state-of-the-art approaches across most of the settings.
