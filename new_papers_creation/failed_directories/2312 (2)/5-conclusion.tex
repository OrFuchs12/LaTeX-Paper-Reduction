For weakly supervised temporal video grounding, we have proposed Gaussian mixture proposals with a pull-push learning scheme to capture diverse events.
We express arbitrary shapes of a temporal location by learning importance, centroid, and range of every Gaussian in the mixture.
To produce moderately coupled Gaussians in the mixture, we leverage a pulling loss and a pushing loss, each of which plays an opposite role to the other.
Through experimental comparisons and extensive ablation studies, we have verified that our method generates multiple high-quality proposals, which greatly improve recall rates.

\paragraph{Limitations.}
We use the proposals with the shape of a Gaussian mixture, but other shapes could be explored to represent complex temporal structures.
% Therefore, we exploit another shape of masks in Supplementary material.
