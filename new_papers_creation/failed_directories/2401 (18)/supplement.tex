\section{Dataset}
We collected four labeled dynamic network datasets without node features, including Enron, Highschool \cite{crawford2018cluenet}, DBLP, Cora \cite{hou2020glodyne}. Here we introduce the detailed information of these datasets.
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Enron} dataset records the email communications of 182 employees between 2000 and 2002, with each employee having one of 7 labels representing their role in the company. The initial snapshot has 76 nodes and 161 edges, and the final snapshot has 18 nodes and 22 edges. 
    \item \textbf{Highschool} dataset corresponds to contacts between 327 students in a high school in Marseilles, France over five days, with each student having one of 9 labels representing classes. We divide one day into 10 intervals, so there are 50 snapshots in total. The initial snapshot has 279 nodes and 791 edges, and the final snapshot has 76 nodes and 80 edges. 
    \item \textbf{DBLP} dataset is a co-author network in the computer science field. The label of an author is defined by the fields in which the author has the most publications, and there are 15 labels in total. The 8 snapshots (1985-1992) are taken out to form this dynamic network. The initial snapshot has 1679 nodes and 3445 edges, and the final snapshot has 12107 nodes and 25841 edges. For \textbf{DBLP$_{dyn}$} dataset, we take 10 snapshots (2010-2019) and remove nodes with unknown labels. Note that DBLP is an accumulative network where nodes and edges do not disappear once they are added. In contrast, the coauthor communities of DBLP$_{dyn}$ appear and disappear dynamically.
% The original dataset comes from https://dblp.org/xml/release.
    \item \textbf{Cora} dataset is a citation network where each node represents a paper, and an edge between two nodes represents a citation. Each paper is assigned a label (from 10 different labels) based on its field of publication. The 11 snapshots (1989-1999) are taken out to form its dynamic network. The initial snapshot has 348 nodes and 481 edges, and the final snapshot has 12022 nodes and 45421 edges. 
\end{itemize}

\noindent\textbf{Fig. \ref{Fig.emb_loss_decrease}} shows the evolution of node embedding during the training process of TopoReg. The colors represent the clustering results and the marker represents the ground truth labels. The squares and vertical crosses are initially erroneously clustered in the orange cluster, and as the epoch increases, the wasserstein distance loss decreases, and the nodes represented by the squares and crosses gradually spread out and split into two communities.

\noindent\textbf{Fig. \ref{Fig.metrics}} shows different evaluation metrics on each snapshots. The first row shows results on Highschool dataset while the second row is on Cora dataset.

\noindent\textbf{Fig. \ref{Fig.topoimprove}} shows the mean and standard deviation of wasserstein distance between community topologies in neighboring snapshots. It can be seen that the mean and the standard deviation have varying degrees of decreases on all four datasets. The results prove that inter-community structure stability is improved after optimization applying TopoReg.


\section{Preliminary Knowledge of Topological Data Analysis}

Topological Data Analysis (TDA) is a rising research area that uses algebraic topology concepts to analyze complex, high dimensional data. Persistent homology is the fundamental methodology in TDA that summarizes the lifetimes of topological features within a filtration as a persistence diagram. We briefly introduce it and refer the readers to \cite{dey2022computational} for more details.

\subsection{Homology}
The key concept of homology theory is to study the properties of an object \(X\), such as a \(p\)-simplex, by means of commutative algebra. A geometric \(p\)-simplex is a convex combination of \(p+1\) (affinely) independent points in \(R^N\). Complex \(K\) is a collection of simplices. A \(p\)-chain is a linear combination of \(p\)-simplices under \(\mathbb{Z}_2\)-coefficients. For a simplex \(\sigma = [x_0, \dots, x_p] \in K\), we define boundary operators as \(\partial_p(\sigma) = \sum_{i=0}^{p}[x_0, \dots , x_{i - 1}, x_{i+1}, \dots , x_p]\) and linearly extend this to chain group \(C_p(K)\), i.e. \(\partial_p( \sum \sigma_i) = \sum \partial_p(\sigma_i)\). In particular, we assign to \(K\) a sequence of chain groups \(C_0, C_1, \dots\) , which are connected by boundary operators \(\partial_n : C_n  \rightarrow C_{n-1}\) such that \(\operatorname{im} (\sigma_{n+1}) \subset \operatorname{ker} (\sigma_n)\). By studying its homology groups \(H_n = \operatorname{ker} (\sigma_n)/\operatorname{im} (\sigma_{n+1})\), we can derive topology properties of \(K\). In this case, the ranks of homology groups yield directly interpretable properties, e.g. \(rank(H_0)\) reflects the number of connected components and \(rank(H_1)\) the number of loops. We call it betti number \(\beta_p(K)=dim(H_p) = rank(Z_p)-rank(B_p)\).


% \subsection{Homology}
% The key concept of homology theory is to study the properties of an object $X$, such as a $p$-simplex, by means of commutative algebra. A geometric $p$-simplex is a convex combination of $p+1$ (affinely) independent points in $R^N$. Complex $K$ is a collection of simplices. A $p$-chain is a linear combination of $p$-simplices under $\mathbb{Z}_2$-coefficients. For a simplex $\sigma = [x_0, \dots, x_p] \in K$, we define boundary operators as $\partial_p(\sigma) = \sum_{i=0}^{p}[x_0, \dots , x_{i - 1}, x_{i+1}, \dots , x_p]$ and linearly extend this to chain group $C_p(K)$, i.e. $\partial_p( \sum \sigma_i) = \sum \partial_p(\sigma_i)$. In particular, we assign to $K$ a sequence of chain groups $C_0, C_1, \dots$ , which are connected by boundary operators $\partial_n : C_n  \rightarrow C_{n-1}$ such that $\operatorname{im} (\sigma_{n+1}) \subset \operatorname{ker} (\sigma_n)$. By studying its homology groups $H_n = \operatorname{ker} (\sigma_n)/\operatorname{im} (\sigma_{n+1})$, we can derive topology properties of $K$. In this case, the ranks of homology groups yield directly interpretable properties, e.g. $rank(H_0)$ reflects the number of connected components and $rank(H_1)$ the number of loops. We call it betti number $\beta_p(K)=dim⁡(H_p) = rank(Z_p)-rank(B_p)$. 

\subsection{Persistent Homology}
Let $\left(K^i\right)_{i=0}^m$ be a sequence of simplicial complexes such that $\emptyset=K^0 \subseteq K^1 \subseteq \cdots \subseteq K^m=K$. Then, $\left(K^i\right)_{i=0}^m$ is called a filtration of $K$. Using the extra information provided by the filtration of $K$, we obtain a sequence of chain complexes where $C_p^i=C_p\left(K_p^i\right)$. This leads to the concept of persistent homology groups, i.e.,

$$
H_p^{i, j}=\operatorname{ker} \partial_p^i /\left(\operatorname{im} \partial_{p+1}^j \cap \operatorname{ker} \partial_p^i\right) \quad \text { for } \quad 1 \leq i \leq j \leq m .
$$

The ranks, $\beta_p^{i, j} = rank(H_p^{i, j})$, of these homology groups (i.e. the $p$-th persistent Betti numbers), capture the number of homological features of dimension $p$ that persist from $i$ to (at least) $j$. we can construct a multiset by inserting the point $(a_i , a_j ), 1 \leq i < j \leq m$, with multiplicity $\mu_p^{i, j}=\left(\beta_p^{i, j-1}-\beta_p^{i, j}\right)-\left(\beta_p^{i-1, j-1}-\beta_p^{i-1, j}\right)$ . This effectively encodes the $p$-dimensional persistent homology of $K$ w.r.t. the given filtration. This representation is called a persistence barcode $B_p$, or in the form of a diagram called persistence diagram $D_p$. There are many metrics for  persistent homology, and one of them, called Wasserstein distance, is defined as the optimal transport distance between the points of the two diagrams:
\subsection{Wasserstein distance}
% \definition{1 (Wasserstein distance)}{
    For $p>0$, the $p$-Wasserstein distance between two persistence diagrams $D_k^{(1)}$ and $D_k^{(2)}$ is defined
$$
\mathrm{W}_{p, q}\left(D_k^{(1)}, D_k^{(2)}\right)=\inf _{\gamma: D_k^{(1)} \rightarrow D_k^{(2)}}\left(\sum_{x \in D_k^{(1)}}\|x-\gamma(x)\|_q^p\right)^{1 / p},
$$
    where $\|\cdot\|_q$ denotes the $q$-norm, $1 \leq q \leq \infty$ and $\gamma$ ranges over all bijections between $D_k^{(1)}$ and $D_k^{(2)}$.

\subsection{Weight Rank Clique Filtration}
Weight rank clique filtration (WRCF) \cite{petri2013topological} prioritizes the addition of edges with larger weights before those with smaller weights to emphasize the importance of edge weights. Specifically, the WRCF algorithm progressively creates unweighted graphs at each filtration step and extracts maximal cliques as simplices for further study. After obtaining a filtered complex on which we can subsequently apply persistent homology. This approach presents one of the feasible methods for applying persistent homology to temporal networks \cite{lozeve2018topological}.

\subsection{Gradient of Persistence Homology}
Substantial research advancements have been made in the field of topological optimization targeting persistence homology \cite{brüelgabrielsson2020topology,vandaele2022topologically}. Given an input filtration $f: \mathcal{X} \rightarrow$ $\mathbb{R}$, we can compute the gradient of a functional of a persistence diagram $\mathcal{E}\left(\mathrm{dgm}_k\right) =\mathcal{E}\left(\{ (b_i, d_i) \}_{i \in I_k}\right)
$ by mapping each birth-death pair to the cells that respectively created and destroyed the homology class, defining an inverse map
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:inv map}
\pi^k_f:\left\{b_i, d_i\right\}_{i \in I_k} \rightarrow(\sigma, \tau) .
\end{equation}
In the case where the ordering on simplices is strict, the map is unique, and we compute the gradient as:
\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial \mathcal{E}}{\partial \sigma}=\sum_{i \in I_k} \frac{\partial \mathcal{E}}{\partial b_i} \mathbf{1}(\pi^k_f\left(b_i\right)=\sigma)+\sum_{i \in I_k} \frac{\partial \mathcal{E}}{\partial d_i} \mathbf{1}(\pi^k_f\left(d_i\right)=\sigma)
\end{equation}
in which at most one term have a non-zero indicator. With the inverse map, we can skip the derivation of the topological calculations and directly optimize the filtration value of the corresponding simplex, which is the output of clustering module in the neural network in our method. Based on this concept, this paper extends the optimization of persistence homology to the scenario of graph filtration.

% \begin{equation*}
%     L_{\text{topo}} = \sum_{t=1}^{T-1} \sum_{k \in \{1,2\}} \left( W_{p,q} \left( dgm_k(M^{(t)}), dgm_k(M^{(t-1)}) \right) \right) + W_{p,q} \left( dgm_k(M^{(t)}), dgm_k(M^{(t+1)}) \right).
