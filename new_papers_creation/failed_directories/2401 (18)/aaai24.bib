abstract = {Deep clustering learns deep feature representations that favor clustering task using neural networks. Some pioneering work proposes to simultaneously learn embedded features and perform clustering by explicitly defining a clustering oriented loss. Though promising performance has been demonstrated in various applications, we observe that a vital ingredient has been overlooked by these work that the defined clustering loss may corrupt feature space, which leads to non-representative meaningless features and this in turn hurts clustering performance. To address this issue, in this paper, we propose the Improved Deep Embedded Clustering (IDEC) algorithm to take care of data structure preservation. Specifically, we manipulate feature space to scatter data points using a clustering loss as guidance. To constrain the manipulation and maintain the local structure of data generating distribution, an under-complete autoencoder is applied. By integrating the clustering loss and autoencoder's reconstruction loss, IDEC can jointly optimize cluster labels assignment and learn features that are suitable for clustering with local structure preservation. The resultant optimization problem can be effectively solved by mini-batch stochastic gradient descent and backpropagation. Experiments on image and text datasets empirically validate the importance of local structure preservation and the effectiveness of our algorithm.},

abstract = {A supervised learning algorithm, Pseudoinverse Learning Algorithm (PIL), for feedforward neural networks is developed. The algorithm is based on generalized linear algebraic methods, and it adopts matrix inner products and pseudoinverse operations. Incorporating with network architecture of which the number of hidden layer neuron is equal to the number of examples to be learned, the algorithm eliminates learning errors by adding hidden layers and will give an exact solution (perfect learning). Unlike the existing gradient descent algorithm, the PIL is a feedforward only, fully automated algorithm, including no critical user-dependent parameters such as learning rate or momentum constant. The algorithm is tested on case studies with stacked generalization applications to software reliability growth data. The results indicate that the proposed algorithm is very efficient for the investigation on the computation-intensive generalization techniques.}

In contrast to recurrent and convolutional neural networks, it does not explicitly model relative or absolute position information in its structure. Instead, it requires adding representations of absolute positions to its inputs. In this work we present an alternative approach, extending the self-attention mechanism to efficiently consider representations of the relative positions, or distances between sequence elements. On the WMT 2014 English-to-German and English-to-French translation tasks, this approach yields improvements of 1.3 BLEU and 0.3 BLEU over absolute position representations, respectively. Notably, we observe that combining relative and absolute position representations yields no further improvement in translation quality. We describe an efficient implementation of our method and cast it as an instance of relation-aware self-attention mechanisms that can generalize to arbitrary graph-labeled inputs.",

abstract = {Despite many empirical successes of spectral clustering methods— algorithms that cluster points using eigenvectors of matrices derived from the data—there are several unresolved issues. First. there are a wide variety of algorithms that use the eigenvectors in slightly different ways. Second, many of these algorithms have no proof that they will actually compute a reasonable clustering. In this paper, we present a simple spectral clustering algorithm that can be implemented using a few lines of Matlab. Using tools from matrix perturbation theory, we analyze the algorithm, and give conditions under which it can be expected to do well. We also show surprisingly good experimental results on a number of challenging clustering problems.},

All these experimental results were obtained with new initialization or training mechanisms. Our objective here is to understand better why standard gradient descent from random initialization is doing so poorly with deep neural networks, to better understand these recent relative successes and help design better algorithms in the future.  We first observe the influence of the non-linear activations functions. We find that the logistic sigmoid activation is unsuited for deep networks with random initialization because of its mean value, which can drive especially the top hidden layer into saturation. Surprisingly, we find that saturated units can move out of saturation by themselves, albeit slowly, and explaining the plateaus sometimes seen when training neural networks. We find that a new non-linearity that saturates less can often be beneficial. Finally, we study how activations and gradients vary across layers and during training, with the idea that training may be more difficult when the singular values of the Jacobian associated with each layer are far from 1.  Based on these considerations, we propose a new initialization scheme that brings substantially faster convergence.}

abstract = {Community detection in dynamic networks has been extensively studied since it sheds light on the structure-function relation of the overall complex systems. Recently, it has been demonstrated that the structural perturbation in static networks is excellent in characterizing the topology. In order to investigate the perturbation structural theory in dynamic networks, we extend the theory by considering the dynamic variation information between networks of consecutive time. Then a novel similarity is proposed by combing structural perturbation and topological features. Finally, we present an evolutionary clustering algorithm to detect dynamic communities under the temporal smoothness framework. Experimental results on both artificial and real dynamic networks demonstrate that the proposed similarity is promising in dynamic community detection since it improves the clustering accuracy compared with state-of-the-art methods, indicating the superiority of the presented similarity measure.}

ABSTRACT = {Compressed sensing is an alternative to Shannon/Nyquist sampling for acquiring sparse or compressible signals. Sparse coding represents a signal as a sparse linear combination of atoms, which are elementary signals derived from a predefined dictionary. Compressed sensing, sparse approximation, and dictionary learning are topics similar to sparse coding. Matrix completion is the process of recovering a data matrix from a subset of its entries, and it extends the principles of compressed sensing and sparse approximation. The nonnegative matrix factorization is a low-rank matrix factorization technique for nonnegative data. All of these low-rank matrix factorization techniques are unsupervised learning techniques, and can be used for data analysis tasks, such as dimension reduction, feature extraction, blind source separation, data compression, and knowledge discovery. In this paper, we survey a few emerging matrix factorization techniques that are receiving wide attention in machine learning, signal processing, and statistics. The treated topics are compressed sensing, dictionary learning, sparse representation, matrix completion and matrix recovery, nonnegative matrix factorization, the Nystr&ouml;m method, and CUR matrix decomposition in the machine learning framework. Some related topics, such as matrix factorization using metaheuristics or neurodynamics, are also introduced. A few topics are suggested for future investigation in this article.},

abstract = {As the molecular representation of the genetic code, tRNA plays a central role in the translational machinery where it interacts with several proteins and other RNAs during the course of protein synthesis. These interactions exploit the dynamic flexibility of tRNA. In this minireview, we discuss the effects of modified bases, ions, and proteins on tRNA structure and dynamics and the challenges of observing its motions over the cycle of translation.}
