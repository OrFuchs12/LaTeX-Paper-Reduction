\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

This paper systematically studied how the server momentum could help alleviate client drift that arises from both data heterogeneity and system heterogeneity. We demonstrated the critical role of momentum schemes and proper hyperparameter schedule by providing a rigorous convergence analysis and extensive empirical evidence, which pave a way for more widely and disciplined use of server momentum in the federated learning research community.
