\section{Summary}

In this paper, we introduce Auto311, the first automated system tailored for non-emergency call management. Our evaluations with real-world and emulated interactions show strong performance in (1) incident type prediction, (2) case report generation, and (3) enhanced follow-up conversations using confidence-based guidance. 
In future work, we will enhance Auto311 and deploy it to handle non-emergency calls in the real world.
By reducing the 
burden through non-emergency callers, residents in critical need of assistance through 911 will receive a fast and effective response. 



% This system performs several key functions, including categorizing ongoing calls, enhancing the conversation's effectiveness, and generating internal reports.
