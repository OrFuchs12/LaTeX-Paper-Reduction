We explore automatic split error correction in the neuron reconstruction pipeline by introducing a comprehensive dataset and extensively studying different image and morphology representations for connectivity prediction. Additionally, we propose a novel connectivity-aware contrastive learning method to learn discriminative EM image embeddings. Integrating the image embeddings with point clouds shows superiority over other methods in identifying connectivity between over-segmented neuron fragments in a huge volume of electronic microscopy images of a fly brain. For the future work, we intend to study beyond pairwise connection prediction. Reasoning the segment connectivity by considering multiple candidates together and the tracing history could yield more accurate decision and facilitate fully automatic complete neuron tracing.
