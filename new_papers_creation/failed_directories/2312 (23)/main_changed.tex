The increasing size of large language models (LLMs) has introduced challenges in their training and inference. Removing model components is perceived as a solution to tackle the large model sizes, however, existing pruning methods solely focus on performance, without considering an essential aspect for the responsible use of LLMs: model fairness. It is crucial to address the fairness of LLMs towards diverse groups, such as women, Black people, LGBTQ+, Jewish communities, among others, as they are being deployed and available to a wide audience. In this work, first, we investigate how attention heads impact fairness and performance in pre-trained transformer-based language models. We then propose a novel method to prune the attention heads that negatively impact fairness while retaining the heads critical for performance, \textit{i.e.} language modeling capabilities. Our approach is practical in terms of time and resources, as it does not require fine-tuning the final pruned, and fairer, model. Our findings demonstrate a reduction in gender bias by $19\%$, $19.5\%$, $39.5\%$, $34.7\%$, $23\%$, and $8\%$ for DistilGPT-2, GPT-2, GPT-Neo of two different sizes, GPT-J, and Llama $2$ models, respectively, in comparison to the biased model, with only a slight decrease in performance. \textit{WARNING: This work uses language that is offensive in nature.}

\section{Introduction}

% The remarkable performance of large language models \goncalo{(LLMs)} in a wide range of natural language processing (NLP) tasks has facilitated their extensive incorporation into various aspects of our daily lives \goncalo{simply say various applications instead?}\cite{liu2022brio,wang2018glue,rajpurkar2018know,rajpurkar2016squad,li2019unified,li2019dice,yu-etal-2020-named,ijcai2020p560}. Nonetheless, this advancement has been accompanied by a mounting concern surrounding the fairness and neutrality \goncalo{what is the difference between both terms?} of these models. Extensive research has highlighted the tendency of language models to generate biased outputs, raising the need for a thorough examination of biases related to gender, race, and sexual orientation \cite{nadeem2021stereoset,meade2021empirical,zayed2022deep}. These biases give rise to serious problems, such as the production of discriminatory text when language models are prompted with sentences about Arabs, resulting in sentences associated with terrorism.

The extensive adoption of large language models (LLMs) in diverse natural language processing tasks has proven highly successful, leading to their integration into various applications \cite{liu2022brio,wang2018glue,rajpurkar2018know,rajpurkar2016squad,li2019unified,li2019dice,yu-etal-2020-named,ijcai2020p560}. However, this progress has also brought up concerns about the fairness of these models. Numerous studies have revealed a troubling trend in which LLMs generate biased outputs for different genders, races, or sexual orientations \cite{nadeem2021stereoset,meade2021empirical,zayed2022deep,zayed2023should}.
These biases can give rise to serious problems, such as the generation of discriminatory text; for example,  when language models are prompted with sentences about Arabs, they produce continuations with references to terrorism \cite{nadeem2021stereoset}.
% Such biases can result in the creation of discriminatory text, particularly evident when the models are prompted with sentences related to certain groups, like Arabs, leading to the production of sentences associated with terrorism. Addressing these biases is crucial to avoid serious problems arising from the misuse of language models.

% The remarkable achievements of large language models \goncalo{LLMs} have served as a motivating force for both the research and industrial communities, driving efforts to develop even larger models trained on more extensive datasets with the aim of further leveraging their capabilities \cite{smith2022using,brown2020language,cohen2022lamda,rae2021scaling,lieber2021jurassic,hoffmann2022training}. However, the pursuit of scaling up these models has presented challenges in terms of conducting fine-tuning and even pre-training \goncalo{use training instead?} from scratch. \goncalo{Pruning the model offers a}As a potential solution to address the issue of increasing model sizes, model pruning has emerged \goncalo{remove model pruning has  emerged}. Nevertheless, existing pruning methods primarily prioritize the removal of model components that have minimal impact on performance, often overlooking considerations related to fairness implications \cite{Fan2020Reducing,voita-etal-2019-analyzing,fan-etal-2021-layer,behnke-heafield-2021-pruning,prasanna-etal-2020-bert,voita-etal-2019-analyzing}. Furthermore, these methods frequently assume that a pruned model will undergo subsequent fine-tuning, which is unrealistic given the substantial size of modern \goncalo{$\rightarrow$ current} language models.
%\goncalo{inference is also affected with the increased model sizes}
% The achievements of LLMs have sparked enthusiasm in both the research and industrial sectors to create even larger models, trained on more extensive datasets, to further harness their capabilities
To further expand their abilities, there has been a trend of increasingly larger models trained on extensive datasets \cite{smith2022using,brown2020language,cohen2022lamda,rae2021scaling,lieber2021jurassic,hoffmann2022training}. However, this pursuit of larger models has introduced challenges for training and inference. To address the issue of increasing model size, model pruning has emerged as a potential solution. Nevertheless, current pruning methods tend to focus on removing model components that have minimal impact on performance, often overlooking fairness implications \cite{Fan2020Reducing,voita-etal-2019-analyzing,fan-etal-2021-layer,behnke-heafield-2021-pruning,prasanna-etal-2020-bert,voita-etal-2019-analyzing}. Additionally, these methods frequently assume that a pruned model will undergo fine-tuning, which is becoming more and more impractical given the substantial increase in size of
modern language models. As a result, there is a need for more thoughtful pruning approaches that consider not only performance, but also model fairness.% the balance between performance and fairness considerations.

% Numerous pruning methods have extensively explored the presence of particular attention heads that hold paramount importance in preserving the model's language modeling capability, which are referred to as important heads for performance. In contrast, there exist other
%attention heads whose elimination does not significantly impact the language modeling ability, designating them as non-important heads \goncalo{for performance}. Certain studies \goncalo{citations?} have compellingly demonstrated the interpretability of these crucial \goncalo{these crucial $\rightarrow$ such important} attention heads by showing their roles in solving the downstream task. In the present study, we endeavor to extend this intriguing \goncalo{why is it intriguing? Remove this word?} notion to the domain of fairness, by identifying attention heads that bear significance in promoting fairness within the model. This pursuit involves a systematic calculation of the individual contributions made by each attention head towards fostering \goncalo{performance as well as }fairness.

Numerous pruning methods have highlighted that certain attention heads are critical for maintaining language modeling ability, while others appear superfluous to model performance \cite{voita-etal-2019-analyzing,NEURIPS2019_2c601ad9,he-choi-2021-stem,bian-etal-2021-attention,zhang-etal-2021-enlivening}. Some studies have shown that these important heads play an interpretable role in downstream tasks \cite{wang2022interpretability,voita-etal-2019-analyzing,he-choi-2021-stem}. %In our current research,
In our work, we explore the possibility of extending this concept to fairness by identifying attention heads that are responsible for promoting bias. To achieve this, we compute separate scores to quantify the contribution of each attention head toward both
performance and bias. These scores serve as our guide in selectively removing attention heads to improve fairness with minimal performance loss. Put simply, we propose to prioritize pruning the heads that contribute the most to bias, %if
given that they are not crucial for language modeling. %The contributions of this paper

% \item We measure the impact of removing attention heads on bias within language models, using this as an indicator of their influence on the overall bias of the model.

\item We propose a novel structured pruning method that considers both fairness and performance. Our method avoids pruning the heads that are important for language modeling, while prioritizing pruning the heads that negatively impact fairness.

% Large language models have found widespread success in various natural language processing (NLP) tasks \cite{liu2022brio,wang2018glue,rajpurkar2018know,rajpurkar2016squad,li2019unified,li2019dice,yu-etal-2020-named,ijcai2020p560}, leading to their increased integration into our everyday lives. This success has motivated both the research and industrial communities to develop even larger models trained on more extensive datasets, aiming to further harness their capabilities \cite{smith2022using,brown2020language,cohen2022lamda,rae2021scaling,lieber2021jurassic,hoffmann2022training}. However, this pursuit of bigger models has hindered the ability to do fine-tuning, let alone pre-training from scratch. Model pruning, --- along with compression, distillation, and quantization --- has emerged as a potential solution to the increase in model sizes. However, pruning methods primarily prioritize removing model components that have minimal impact on performance, without considering fairness implications \cite{Fan2020Reducing,voita-etal-2019-analyzing,fan-etal-2021-layer,behnke-heafield-2021-pruning,prasanna-etal-2020-bert,voita-etal-2019-analyzing}.

\section{Related Work}
This section delves into a more detailed discussion of various pruning methods and the existing bias assessment metrics employed in language generation models.

\subsection{Pruning of Large Language Models}
Pruning of large language models can be split into two main categories: structured and unstructured pruning \cite{behnke2021pruning}. Structured pruning involves removing specific building blocks within the model, such as attention heads or layers, which alters the overall model structure. On the other hand, unstructured pruning is more fine-grained, entailing the removal of certain model weights  \cite{narang2017exploring,h.2018to}, while retaining the original structure of the network. Structured pruning typically leads to faster models, while unstructured pruning results in less performance degradation \cite{behnke2021pruning}. In this study, we focus on structured pruning to explore the impact of attention heads on fairness through targeted removal, which represents a relatively unexplored research avenue.

Some of the pioneering works in the application of structural pruning were conducted by \citet{voita-etal-2019-analyzing} and \citet{NEURIPS2019_2c601ad9}, where the authors explored the removal of attention heads from transformer-based models. Their findings revealed the presence of important heads in terms of performance. While the removal of important heads led to model collapse, less critical heads had minimal impact on performance. Building upon these works, \citet{he-choi-2021-stem} conducted a detailed analysis of the important heads, demonstrating their interpretable roles in task-solving.

Meanwhile, \citet{bian-etal-2021-attention} focused on investigating the non-important heads and concluded that these heads were redundant since their output exhibited a high correlation with other heads, making them inconsequential for final predictions. To address this, \citet{zhang-etal-2021-enlivening} proposed an approach for transforming non-important heads into important heads by injecting task-specific prior knowledge, thereby increasing their contribution to the output. In a separate study, \citet{sajjad2023effect} examined layer removal in BERT  \cite{devlin2018bert} with fine-tuning and showcased the importance of preserving lower layers to maintain performance. Furthermore, \citet{Fan2020Reducing} investigated layer removal without fine-tuning and achieved considerable performance preservation through the implementation of layer dropout during training. The lottery ticket hypothesis \cite{frankle2018the}, which suggests the existence of subnetworks capable of achieving comparable performance to that of the full network, has paved the way for numerous unstructured pruning techniques. For example, \citet{behnke-heafield-2020-losing} applied this principle to language models, while \citet{prasanna-etal-2020-bert} provided evidence that early-stage pruning during training outperforms post-convergence pruning.
%\goncalo{We should aim to reduce this paragraph if possible. We should also point out that most pruning methods involve fine-tuning, but not ours.}
%It is important to mention the majority of the methods discussed require fine-tuning the model after pruning.


%Additionally, \citet{fan-etal-2021-layer} introduced a pruning approach for transformer-based models that involves reducing the dimensionality of hidden representations across different layers while simultaneously maximizing the interdependence between representations in consecutive layers.

\subsection{Fairness Assessment in Text Generation Models}\label{sec:fairness_metrics}
%\goncalo{do we need to specify WEAT, CEAT, and SEAT? Are we using it later? If not, we can mention only the authors and not the methods as we have been doing so far.}
%\citet{guo2021detecting} build upon this concept by extending the analysis from static embeddings to contextualized embeddings. Similarly, \citet{may2019measuring} further expand the evaluation to sentence-level embeddings.
Metrics to assess fairness in text generation models may be classified into two main categories: intrinsic metrics and extrinsic metrics. Intrinsic metrics evaluate the model's bias independently of any downstream task. For instance, some works measure bias by analyzing the correlation between token representations of different groups and specific stereotypical associations \cite{caliskan2017semantics,guo2021detecting,may2019measuring}.  These metrics operate under the assumption that bias within language models can solely be detected through the analysis of the embedding space. Therefore, they do not rely on a specific task to evaluate the model's bias. However, it has been suggested that embedding space does not consistently align with the model's bias when deployed to solve a given task \cite{cao-etal-2022-intrinsic,delobelle-etal-2022-measuring}.

Some intrinsic metrics employ synthetic templates to measure bias based on the model's output predictions  \cite{webster2020measuring,kurita2019measuring}. For example, if the model assigns a higher likelihood to the sentence âshe is a nurseâ, compared to âhe is a nurseâ, it indicates the presence of gender bias. These templates are constrained in their coverage of stereotypical associations, resulting in divergent rankings of bias among different templates when applied to the same models \cite{delobelle-etal-2022-measuring}. While some metrics have substituted templates with crowd-sourced examples \cite{nadeem2021stereoset,nangia2020crows}, they have encountered challenges related to grammatical correctness, logical coherence, and relevance in a significant number of sentences \cite{blodgett2021stereotyping}. %\goncalo{Overall, I think we should also reduce these sentences since we will be using extrinsic metrics instead.

% Other metrics, such as Stereoset \cite{nadeem2021stereoset} and CrowS-Pairs \cote{nangia2020crows}, replace templates with crowd-sourced examples. These metrics consider the model to be fair if the average likelihood of stereotypical sentences (\textit{e.g.}, âgirls are softer than boysâ) is equal to that of anti-stereotypical sentences (\textit{e.g.}, âgirls are tougher than boysâ). These intrinsic metrics provide insights into bias within the model itself, regardless of specific tasks.

The second category of bias assessment metrics comprises extrinsic metrics, which evaluate bias within the context of a specific task. For example, metrics such as Winobias \cite{zhao-etal-2018-gender}, Winogender \cite{rudinger2018gender}, and BUG \cite{levy2021collecting} focus on measuring bias in coreference resolution. In this task, given a sentence like âThe doctor told the nurse she will perform the surgery in two daysâ, identifying the word ânurse" as a referent for âsheâ indicates the presence of gender bias. Some of these metrics have a limited number of examples provided within the templates, which poses challenges in drawing definitive conclusions based on the measured bias. For instance, the Winobias \cite{zhao-etal-2018-gender}, Winogender \cite{rudinger2018gender}, and CrowS-Pairs \cite{nangia2020crows} metrics employ templates with only  $3$k, $120$, and $1.5$k examples, respectively.

% Additionally, another metric has replaced templates with prompts sourced from Wikipedia \cite{dhamala2021bold}. However, these prompts present distinct contexts for each group, making it challenging to ascertain whether the disparity in output probability is a result of bias or contextual differences. Another critical limitation found in several proposed metrics is the limited number of examples provided within the templates. This constraint poses challenges in drawing definitive conclusions based on the measured bias. For instance, the Winobias \cite{zhao2018gender}, Winogender \cite{rudinger2018gender}, and CrowS-Pairs \cite{nangia2020crows} metrics employ templates with only 120, 1.5k, and 1.6k examples, respectively.

Another extrinsic metric, BOLD \cite{dhamala2021bold}, employs $23$k prompts sourced from Wikipedia that refer to diverse groups based on gender, race, professions, religions, and political ideologies. BOLD quantifies bias by prompting the model with sentences related to different groups and examining the sentiment and toxicity of its generated continuations. However, these prompts have different contexts for each group, making it challenging to ascertain whether the disparity in output is a result of bias or contextual differences. Taking this into account, Holistic bias \cite{smith2022m} is a more recent work that provides $566$k prompts covering $13$ different social biases without contextual changes. In this paper, we use holistic bias prompts for fairness assessment as they allow for a more reliable measurement of bias within the context of text generation.

%\section{Background: Social Bias Quantification}\label{sec:background}
\section{Social Bias Assessment}\label{sec:background}

To assess the extent of social bias inherent in text generation models, we adopt the procedure in the work conducted by \citet{dhamala2021bold}. Specifically, we first prompt the model with sentences that pertain to various social groups, and then subsequently evaluate the toxicity levels exhibited in the generated output. An output is considered toxic if it refers to content that leads individuals to disengage from a discussion \cite{dixon2018measuring}. Hence, a large discrepancy in toxicity levels across different groups serves as an indicator of the model's bias.

% More formally, to quantify a certain type of social bias $B$, let's say race bias, we check the model's toxicity on all the subgroups $b$ in this bias


% More formally, to quantify the bias against a certain group $G$, for example race bias,

% We denote the group for which the bias is measured as $g$, which refers to race, religion, sexual orientaion, nationality, and gender. For each group, we have a number of subgroups $g_i$, such as gay, lesbian, straight, etc. for sexual orientation bias, where $i$ for $i$ $\in$ $\{1,2,..N\}$ represents the specific subgroup and $N$ is the total number of subgroups.
Inspired by \citet{dixon2018measuring}, our initial step for evaluating a specific form of social bias involves establishing a set of subgroups, denoted as $S$, which are deemed as relevant to measure such bias. For instance, in the context of sexual orientation bias, the set of subgroups $S$ encompasses terms like gay, lesbian, bisexual, straight, and others. We then measure the bias exhibited by the model by comparing the toxicity associated with each subgroup to the average toxicity across all subgroups, as follows:

% To measure a certain type of social bias, we first begin by defining a set of the subgroups $S$ that are included in this bias. For example, for the case of sexual-orientation bias, the set of subgroups $S$  includes subgroups such as gay, lesbian, bisexual, straight, etc.  Following \citet{dixon2018measuring}, the model's bias is the based on the difference between its toxicity for each subgroup and the average toxicity for all subgroups.
%To measure the bias against a specific identity group $g$, for example sexual orientation bias, we measure the model's toxicity to all the subgroups denoted by $g_i$ for $i $\in$ $\{1,2,..\}$ For a specific bias, for examples sexual orientation bias, denoted by As such, bias can be expressed as follows:

% E_{x \textrm{} \sim \textrm{} D }(bias(x)|do(head_h = 1) - bias(x)|do(head_h = 1))

 \begin{equation}
    bias_{\phi}(S) = E_{x \textrm{} \sim \textrm{} D }(\sum_{s \in S }|\textrm{E}_{s}tox_{\phi}(x(s)) - tox_{\phi}(x(s))|),
 \label{eq:pinned_toxicity}
 \end{equation}
% where $s$ denotes the subgroups that are targeted by the bias, $\textrm{E}_{s}(tox(s))$ represents the mean toxicity of the model's output across all subgroups, while $tox(s)$ represents the mean toxicity in output related to a specific subgroup $s$. Lower values correspond to less bias. Figure \ref{fig:bias_quantification} showcases an example of sexual orientation bias quantification.

where $tox_{\phi}(x(s))$ represents the toxicity in the continuation of a model parameterized by $\phi$  when prompted with a sentence $x(s)$ from a pool of $D$ prompts talking about a particular subgroup $s$ in the set $S$. $\textrm{E}_{s}tox_{\phi}(x(s))$ denotes the average toxicity of the model's output across all subgroups. Lower values indicate less bias. Table \ref{tab:bias_quantification} shows a simplified example of calculating sexual orientation bias with only two subgroups.

\section{Fairness-Aware Structured Pruning}
%Suppose our intention is to remove $10$ attention heads from an attention-based language model through pruning. Existing pruning algorithms, such as the works by \citet{voita-etal-2019-analyzing} and \citet{NEURIPS2019_2c601ad9}, raise the following question: Which 10 heads have the least impact on the model's language modeling capability? Consequently, the term \textit{important heads} has emerged to denote the heads that are essential for effective language modeling.

Existing methods to prune attention heads in transformer models determine the importance of each head based solely on model performance \cite{voita-etal-2019-analyzing,NEURIPS2019_2c601ad9}. In other words, \textit{important heads} are deemed essential to maintain the model's language modeling capability and may therefore not be pruned. In this work, we recognize the equal significance of evaluating the influence of attention heads on fairness, thereby broadening the definition of important heads to encompass not only heads crucial for language modeling but also those that have a positive impact on fairness.

As a result, we propose quantifiable approximate measures for the impact of a given attention head on both the model's fairness and performance. Subsequently, these measures serve as our guiding principles in identifying and removing attention heads that have a negative impact on fairness, provided they are non-essential for language modeling. %, using our proposed fairness and performance aware (FPA) pruning.
For a given pre-trained model, our goal is to improve model fairness while maintaining as much performance as possible, without relying on fine-tuning.
% and head pruning ratio $\alpha$
%We then use these measures to guide us to prune the heads that negatively impact fairness if they are not crucial for language modeling, using our proposed performance and fairness aware (FPA) pruning.
%\subsection{Quantifying the contribution of attention heads to performance and fairness}
\subsection{Attention Head Contributions to Fairness and Performance}
We quantify the contribution of a given attention head to bias as the difference between the modelâs bias before and after pruning such head. More specifically, for a model with $N_h$ attention heads, the impact of each head $h$ $\in$ $\{1, 2, .., N_h\}$ on a social group represented by set $S$, $z_{bias}$($h$,$S$), is estimated as:
\begin{equation}
z_{bias}(h,S) = bias_{\phi}(S)|do(y_h = 1) - bias_{\phi}(S)|do(y_h = 0)
\label{eq:ATE_bias}
\end{equation}
where $bias_{\phi}(S)$ represents the bias of the text generation model parameterized by $\phi$ as described in Eq. \eqref{eq:pinned_toxicity}. Additionally, $do(y_h = 1)$ and $do(y_h = 0)$, respectively, signify the presence and absence of head $h$.
In a similar vein, the impact of a head $h$ in the context of language modeling is defined as:
\begin{equation}
z_{ppl}(h) = ppl_{\phi}|do(y_h = 1) - ppl_{\phi}|do(y_h = 0)
\label{eq:ATE_perf}
\end{equation}
where $ppl_{\phi}$ refers to the perplexity of a model parameterized by $\phi$ on WikiText-2 \cite{meritypointer}.
%\goncalo{For clarity, we should include equations for bias(x) and ppl(x)}
%\goncalo{it is not clear how eq 1 relates to bias(x) here}
Using the effect of removal of a model component as a proxy of its influence on the model's output has been employed in previous studies \cite{rotman2021model}.
%This approach aligns with similar studies \cite{rotman2021model} that evaluate the impact of individual layers by assessing the effects of their removal.
However, it is important to note that the effect of removing multiple heads is not equivalent to the sum of the effects of each head removed individually due to the non-linearity of the model. % , although we approximate it as linear for the purpose of our analysis \goncalo{In other words we can say that we assume all layers are independent}.
Notwithstanding, our experimental results indicate that such simplification is a practical and effective way of estimating the impact of attention heads.


%\subsection{Fairness\goncalo{-} and Performance\goncalo{-}Aware (FPA) pruning}
\subsection{Attention Head Pruning}
Having assessed the influence of each attention head on both fairness and language modeling, we now introduce our %performance and fairness-aware (FPA) pruning approach.
fairness-aware structured pruning (FASP) method. FASP focuses on removing heads that have a negative impact on fairness while ensuring that the model's language modeling ability is minimally affected.

To determine the number of heads to keep, thereby preventing performance decline, we introduce a hyperparameter $\gamma$ representing the ratio of crucial attention heads for language modeling. For instance, $\gamma = 0.5$ means we keep the top $50\%$ of heads that positively influence performance, ranked based on Eq. \eqref{eq:ATE_perf} (lower is better). Then, the remaining heads (\textit{i.e.} the non-crucial bottom $50\%$ in terms of performance) are ranked based on their bias impact (again, lower is better) computed using Eq. \eqref{eq:ATE_bias}. For a given ratio of pruned heads, denoted by $\alpha$, we prune $\alpha$ $\times$ $N_h$ heads from the remaining non-critical heads, based on their bias scores.
%for a given ratio $\alpha$ representing the ratio of pruned heads and prune the top $\alpha\%$ heads
In the end, this sequence of steps allows us to prioritize the removal of those with the highest bias impact while mitigating the loss of language modeling ability. An overview of our method is presented in Algorithm 1.

Figure \ref{fig:head_pruning_1} illustrates how FASP removes attention heads. The heads shown in black are deemed critical for language modeling and, as a result, are excluded from the pruning process.

% \end{figure}

% In this section, we delve into a comprehensive examination of identifying the influence of attention heads on fairness. Our primary objective is to prioritize the elimination of heads that contribute to an increase in bias within the model. Throughout this process, we carefully consider that the removal of these heads does not significantly impact the model's language modeling capability. First, we are going to explain how to quantify the contribution of different attention heads to both performance and fairness, then we will explain how to use this knowledge to prune the model's heads.
% \subsection{Finding the Impact of Attention Heads on Fairness and performance}
% Suppose our intention is to remove 10 attention heads from an attention-based language model through pruning. Existing pruning algorithms, such as the work by \citet{voita-etal-2019-analyzing} \citet{NEURIPS2019_2c601ad9}, raise the following question before proceeding: Which 10 heads have the least impact on the model's language modeling capability? Consequently, the term \textit{important heads} has emerged to denote the heads that are essential for effective language modeling.
% We recognize the equal significance of evaluating the influence of attention heads on fairness, thereby broadening the definition of \textit{important heads} to encompass not only heads crucial for language modeling but also those that have a positive impact on fairness. As a result, we establish a quantifiable measure for assessing the impact of an attention head $i$ on the model's fairness as follows:

% \begin{equation}
% E_{x}(bias(x)|do(head_i = 1) - bias(x)|do(head_i = 1))
% \label{eq:ATE_bias}
% \end{equation}

% In the given expression, $bias(x)$ represents the bias exhibited by the text generation model when utilizing a prompt sentence $x$. Additionally, $head_i = 1$ and $head_i = 0$ signify the presence and absence, respectively, of head number $i$.

% Similarly, the impact of head $i$ on language modeling is expressed as:

% \begin{equation}
% E_{x}(ppl(x)|do(head_i = 1) - ppl(x)|do(head_i = 1))
% \label{eq:ATE_perf}
% \end{equation}

% There are two caveats that warrant emphasis. Firstly, when quantifying the impact of head removal, we adopt a similar approach as other studies that assess the impact of layer removal \cite{rotman2021model}. This involves computing the difference in fairness between before and after pruning the specific head. Secondly, it is important to note that the overall effect of removing multiple heads is not equivalent to the sum of the effects of each head removed individually. This is due to the non-linearity of the model, although we approximate it as linear for the purpose of our analysis. Our findings indicate that while our assumption may not hold true, it serves as a proxy for estimating the overall impact. This approximation has been employed in previous studies as well, such as the work by \citet{rotman2021model}.

\section{Experimental details}

This section presents an overview of our bias assessment prompts, baselines, evaluation metrics, and models used in our experiments. Our code is publicly available\footnote{\url{https://github.com/chandar-lab/FASP}}.%Then, we demonstrate that FASP distinguishes itself from conventional head pruning techniques by taking into account both performance and fairness. Furthermore, we explore whether the heads with the most significant impact on bias are consistent across various social biases. Finally, we study the impact of increasing fairness to a specific bias on other social biases when using our method.
% In this section, we describe our bias assessment prompts, baselines, and evaluations metrics used in our experiments. We show that that our FRA pruning method, unlike the existing head pruning methods, considers both performance and fairness. In addition, we discuss whether the heads with the largest effect on bias are the same for different social biases. Finally, we study the effect of model size on the change in bias due to pruning for all baselines.
\subsection{Bias Assessment Prompts}\label{prompts}
We use the prompts from the holistic bias dataset introduced by \citet{smith2022m}. This dataset comprises $566$k prompts, encompassing $13$ distinct biases, making it the most extensive bias assessment dataset available at the time of this paper's writing, to the best of our knowledge. %Notably, the holistic bias dataset overcomes many of the issues present in other templates, as discussed in the Related Work Section.
Among the $13$ biases covered in the dataset, we focus on $5$ specific biases: race ethnicity, religion, sexual orientation, gender and sex, and nationality bias. Table \ref{tab:dataset_statistics}  in the technical appendix
displays the number of prompts associated with each of these targeted biases, along with some illustrative examples of the prompts for each category. The prompts were split into validation and test sets with a ratio of $0.2$:$0.8$.

% We use the prompts from the holistic bias dataset by \citet{smith2022m}, which consists of $566,625$ prompts covering $13$ different biases, making it the largest dataset for bias assessment at the time of the writing of this paper. In addition to the size of the dataset, holistic bias also is free from most of the issues that exist in the current templates as discussed in the Related Work Section.

\subsection{Baselines}\label{baselines}
% For relative comparison of our proposed pruning method, we use (1) head pruning based on magnitude \cite{han2015learning,han2015deep}, (2) head pruning based on gradient \cite{NEURIPS2019_2c601ad9}, (3) random head pruning, (4), head pruning based only on the fairness score in Eq. \eqref{eq:ATE_bias}, (5) head pruning based only on the language modeling score in Eq. \eqref{eq:ATE_perf}, (6) our FPA pruning method. For all baselines, the model does not undergo fine-tuning after pruning.
We employ the following baseline methods when evaluating our approach: (1) head pruning based on weight magnitude \cite{han2015learning,han2015deep}, (2) head pruning based on gradient magnitude \cite{NEURIPS2019_2c601ad9}, (3) random head pruning, (4) head pruning based only on the fairness score in Eq. \eqref{eq:ATE_bias}, and (5) head pruning based only on the perplexity score in Eq. \eqref{eq:ATE_perf}. %, (6) our FASP method.
%Note that the latter two baselines respectively correspond to using $\gamma = 0$ and $\gamma = 1$ in our method, and w
We refer to the latter two baselines as fairness only and performance only baselines, respectively.
We would like to highlight that the model remains unchanged and does not undergo any fine-tuning after the pruning process for all the mentioned baselines as well as our method.
\subsection{Evaluation Metrics}\label{sec:metrics}
We assess bias by examining the variation in the model's toxicity across various subgroups. For instance, when measuring religion bias, we consider differences in the model's toxicity among the different subgroups such as Muslims, Christians, Jews, and so on, as detailed in Eq. \eqref{eq:pinned_toxicity}. We use BERT for toxicity assessment, similar to the work by \citet{dhamala2021bold}. For performance assessment, we measure the model's perplexity on WikiText-2.
%\goncalo{Say that for performance we analyze the model in terms of language modeling ability using perplexity.}
% Following the work by \cite{dixon2018measuring}, bias is measured as the discrepancy on the modelâs toxicity amongst different subgroups (for example Muslims, Christians, jews, atheists, etc., in case of measuring religion bias), as described in the Background Section.

We employed $6$ pre-trained models available in Hugging Face: DistilGPT-2, GPT-2 \cite{radford2019language}, GPT-Neo \cite{gpt-neo} of two different sizes, GPT-J \cite{gpt-j}, and Llama $2$ \cite{touvron2023llama} models with $88.2$M, $137$M, $125$M, $1.3$B, $6$B, and $7$B parameters, respectively.

\section{Experiments}\label{exp_details}

In the following experiments, we demonstrate that FASP distinguishes itself from conventional head pruning techniques by taking into account both performance and fairness. Furthermore, we explore whether the heads with the most significant impact on bias are consistent across various social biases. Finally, we study the impact of gender bias reduction using our method on other social biases.

FASP introduces a single hyperparameter, which is the ratio of crucial heads for performance, denoted as $\gamma$ and selected based on the validation set. To identify the optimal value $\gamma^*$, we aim to minimize the model's bias while maintaining the perplexity as close as possible compared to the best pruning baseline. The search range for $\gamma$ was set to $\gamma \in \{0.2, ..., 0.7\}$. Additional details about the hyperparameters are provided in the appendix. The code appendix elaborates on dataset preprocessing, experiment procedures and analysis, and the computing infrastructure employed. All results were obtained using $3$ different seeds.

%For complete details regarding the hyperparameters used to obtain the results, please refer to the technical appendix. Additionally, for reproducibility, our code will be made publicly available. The code appendix provides further elaboration on the dataset pre-processing, the experimental procedures and analysis, and the computing infrastructure utilized during the experiments, respectively.

% We use six pre-trained models from hugging face, namely BERT, RoBERTa, GPT2, DistilBERT, DistilRoBERTa, and distilGPT-2. We split the holistic bias prompts into validation and test splits with a ratio of $0.2$:$0.8$. Our proposed method, FPA, uses a single hyperparameter, $\gamma$, which is selected based on the validation set. The criterion for determining the optimal value of $\beta$ is to minimize the modelâs bias, while ensuring the same perplexity as that of magnitude pruning, through a search range of $\gamma \in \{0,0.1,..,1\}$. All the results are obtained by running the experiments for three different seeds.
% Section A.1 in the technical appendix includes all the details needed about the hyper-parameters used to obtain the results. Our code will be publicly available for reproducibility. Sections B.1, B.2, and B.3 in the code appendix provide more details about the pre-processing of the datasets, the procedure to conduct and analyze the experiments, as well as the computing infrastructure used for running the experiments, respectively.

\subsection{Experiment 1: How does FASP perform in terms of bias and language modeling compared to existing pruning methods?}
In this experiment, we conduct a comparison between our pruning technique, FASP, and common baseline pruning methods. Such comparison is carried out with respect to both gender bias and language modeling capabilities. The results depicted in Figure~\ref{fig:gender_bias_pruning} clearly indicate that FASP stands out as the sole pruning method capable of consistently reducing gender bias without perplexity overshooting. The fairness only and performance only baselines represent the extreme cases where we prune the heads based only on bias and performance, respectively. Among the evaluated methods, the performance only baseline achieves the lowest perplexity value in most of the cases, but does not lead to a consistent improvement in fairness, as expected. Following this, in order of performance, are FASP with the best $\gamma$ (\textit{i.e.} $\gamma^*)$, magnitude pruning, and gradient pruning. Magnitude pruning results in perplexity overshooting on GPT-Neo and Llama $2$ models. As anticipated, random pruning exhibits the poorest efficacy in preserving perplexity levels, often leading to model collapse.
Fairness only baseline yields superior fairness outcomes across the majority of scenarios, albeit accompanied by elevated perplexity, often surpassing acceptable levels. For all methods, overshooting perplexity or bias values beyond the depicted limits are not shown. It is important to note that in five out of the six models we examined, we identified a $\gamma^*$ value of $0.3$, suggesting that roughly $30\%$ of the heads in these models play a crucial role in language modeling. Qualitative results are provided in the technical appendix. %\goncalo{We should discuss if we want to include a figure with sensitivity analysis to gamma here.}

\subsection{Experiment 2: Are the heads responsible for bias the same across social biases?}
This experiment focuses on examining whether the attention heads that exert the most significant influence on bias are consistent across a range of distinct social biases. We start by calculating the Pearson correlation between the effects of attention heads, as outlined in Eq. \eqref{eq:ATE_bias}, across varying biases. Figure \ref{fig:correlation_maps} illustrates a consistent positive correlation among attention head effects across diverse biases, with the exception of the religion bias. For this particular bias, the correlation is either slightly negative or non-existent in relation to other biases, depending on the model under consideration. Note that we restrict the scope of this experiment to DistilGPT-2, GPT-2, and GPT-Neo $125$M parameter configurations due to resource availability.

To take a deeper look at how different heads influence different biases, Figure \ref{fig:head_ids_pruned} showcases the indices of the top $20$\% attention heads that yield the most substantial impact on five biases using GPT-2. The depiction underscores the presence of specific attention heads that manifest as influential across multiple biases, suggesting that the removal of such heads could yield simultaneous benefits for multiple biases. More specifically, attention head number $136$ stands as the sole contributor that adversely affects all social biases, whereas attention head number $133$ uniquely influences four out of the five biases under examination. Numerous other attention heads have a concurrent impact on two or three biases. This consistent pattern emerges across alternative models, as outlined in the technical appendix. Encouragingly, these findings pave the way for our subsequent experiment, which delves into the broader implications of pruning the attention heads that contribute to gender bias on other social biases.

%Following this, in order of performance, are FASP with the best $\gamma$ (\textit{i.e.} $\gamma^*)$, magnitude pruning, and gradient pruning.
% It is worth mentioning that we found $\gamma^*$ to be $0.3$ in four out of the five models that we tested, suggesting that approximately $30$$\%$ of the attention heads in these models are critical for language modeling. The technical appendix contains a discussion about how the hyperparameter $\gamma$ affects these results.

% On the other hand, FASP with $\gamma$ $=$ $0$, which only cares about fairness, achieves the best fairness in most of the cases, but with high perplexity that overshoots in many cases.

%\goncalo{Clarify that even though we introduce gamma, gamma=0.3 works well for all the tested models and hence there is no need to perform hyperparameter search.

You can also clarify again what gamma=0 and gamma=1 represent.}

% Only head $136$ has a negative influence on all social biases, while head $133$ affects four out of the five biases under examination. Multiple attention heads simultaneously influence two or three biases. This pattern is consistent across various models, as demonstrated in the technical appendix.

\subsection{Experiment 3: How are other social biases affected when gender bias is reduced?}

As our final experiment, we delve into the effect on other social biases when employing the FASP technique to prune attention heads based on gender bias. Figure~\ref{fig:effect_on_ther_biases_gpt2} shows that the process of pruning attention heads with the most pronounced influence on gender bias leads to a reduction in sexual orientation, race, and nationality biases. This is to be expected since all of these biases are positively correlated with gender bias, as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:correlation_maps}. Since GPT-2 and GPT-Neo exhibit a positive correlation between religion and gender bias head scores (also shown in Figure \ref{fig:correlation_maps}), pruning heads based on gender bias scores continues to diminish religion bias in these models. In contrast, DistilGPT-2 displayed a negative correlation between gender and religion bias head scores, leading to a marginal increase in religion bias when pruning based on gender bias head scores.  Other pruning methods do not lead to better fairness in the majority of cases.
%However, it is important to underscore that across all models, the religion bias absolute values are in proximity to $0$, rendering them insignificant in comparison to other biases.
% In the majority of instances, alternative pruning techniques fail to enhance fairness.

% Notably, the religion bias, which was identified as either uncorrelated or negatively correlated with other social biases, remains unaffected by the pruning process in all models except distilGPT-2 where it gets worse due to the negative correlation between gender bias and religion head scores for this model, as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:correlation_maps}. \goncalo{This is not the case for distilGPT-2 though and this should be discussed.}

% Finally, as previously demonstrated in Experiment 1, it is important to highlight that none of the other pruning methods lead to a reduction in any of the social biases under consideration \goncalo{This is also not always the case... You can say that they do not consistently improve bias instead or that in most cases they don't improve it}.

\section{Conclusion}
This paper examines the impact of pruning attention heads in various language models on their fairness towards several social biases. %genders, ethnic groups, sexual-orientations, nationalities, and religions.
We highlight that current pruning techniques, which prioritize minimizing performance decline, do not take fairness into account. As a result, we propose to consider both performance and fairness considerations when pruning model components. Our experiments show that the proposed approach, FASP, consistently improves the fairness of transformer models while matching the language modeling ability of performance-based pruning methods.% a comparable level of performance degradation.

\section{Technical Appendix}
Within this section, we delve into the range of the hyperparameter $\gamma$ detailing the ultimate values derived from the validation set. We examine its impact on perplexity and bias across various models. Furthermore, we provide a visual representation of the significant attention heads concerning multiple social biases in both DistilGPT-2 and GPT-Neo $125$M. Additionally, we present some qualitative results comparing our proposed pruning method, FASP, against alternative baselines. We also include an overview of the bias assessment prompts statistical information. Conclusively, we engage with the ethical considerations surrounding our work and outline its limitations.

        \label{fig:gender_bias_pruning_gamma}
\end{figure*}

This section outlines the $\gamma$ hyperparameter's value range and its ultimate selection for each model, determined using the validation dataset as per Algorithm 1. Table \ref{tab:hyperparamaters} provides an overview of the various values explored for the hyperparameter $\gamma$ across distinct models, alongside the final values. We used a smaller range for GPT-J, and Llama $2$ due to computational constraints. In five out of the six models we tested, we observed that the $\gamma$ value of $0.3$ offered the most favorable balance between language modeling and bias.

Illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:gender_bias_pruning_gamma}  is the influence of adjusting $\gamma$ on bias and perplexity within different models. Across all models, elevated $\gamma$ values correspond with decreased perplexity, as they indicate the retention of more critical heads during the pruning process. Conversely, smaller $\gamma$ values consistently correlate with enhanced fairness, affording greater latitude to prune heads that contribute significantly to bias. An exception arises with GPT-Neo $1.3$B, wherein fairness improves with reduced $\gamma$ values until a threshold of 0.6 is reached, after which smaller $\gamma$ values do not improve fairness. We suggest that this phenomenon emerges due to the pruning of all heads with adverse effects on fairness at $\gamma=0.6$. Therefore, while reducing $\gamma$ increases the pool of available heads for pruning, fairness does not improve further because, by this juncture, all heads exerting negative impacts have already been eliminated.

\subsection{Additional Results on the Impactful Heads for Bias}

We present the indices of the top $20\%$ attention heads that exert the most notable impact on bias, considering both distilGPT-2 and GPT-Neo with $125$M parameters. Similar to Figure \ref{fig:head_ids_pruned} in the main paper, Figure \ref{fig:head_ids_pruned_more_models_2} shows the existence of certain heads that possess an impact on multiple social biases simultaneously. Pruning these particular heads enhances the model's fairness across various social biases, as demonstrated in Experiment 3.

\caption{Evaluating GPT-2 model continuations with distinct pruning techniques (at $2$\% pruning) using prompts aimed at Native Americans and Guatemalans. While all approaches produce non-toxic extensions for prompts related to Guatemalan individuals, only FASP and the fairness only baseline achieve the same outcome when presented with sentences about Native Americans. This uniformity in toxicity levels underscores FASP's capacity to mitigate bias.

% We present qualitative findings on GPT-2 in Tables \ref{tab:qualitative_examples}

Displayed in Tables \ref{tab:qualitative_examples} through \ref{tab:qualitative_examples_3} are qualitative instances illustrating biases related to sexual orientation and nationality in GPT-2 at $2$$\%$ pruning ratio. Table \ref{tab:qualitative_examples} uses prompts centered around non-binary and transgender groups. When presented with sentences concerning non-binary individuals, all examined methodologies yielded responses devoid of toxicity. However, when the focus transitioned towards prompts pertaining to transgender individuals, it became evident that all pruning strategies except FASP and fairness only baseline generated outputs displaying toxic attributes. In accordance with the bias definition in Eq. \eqref{eq:pinned_toxicity}, wherein bias is defined as the dissimilarity in the model's toxicity across the specified groups, FASP and fairness only baseline have the least bias in this scenario.

In Table \ref{tab:qualitative_examples_2}, GPT-2 was provided with sentences referencing demisexual and bisexual individuals after undergoing pruning via various methods. The outcomes reveal that the generated continuations are non-toxic for the bisexual group across all pruning techniques. However, for the demisexual prompts, all continuations exhibit substantial levels of toxicity, except those stemming from pruning using FASP and the fairness only baseline. Notably, in the demisexual prompt case, both the random and gradient pruning methods eliminate the same specific attention heads, resulting in identical continuations. Moving on to Table \ref{tab:qualitative_examples_3}, another illustrative example is presented, involving prompts concerning distinct nationalities. When discussing Guatemalan individuals, all GPT-2 pruning approaches yield non-toxic output. Conversely, when the focus shifts to native Americans, all methods except FASP and the fairness only baseline generate toxic output.

It's noteworthy to highlight that in both Table \ref{tab:qualitative_examples_2} and Table \ref{tab:qualitative_examples_3}, the random and fairness only baselines resulted in a decline in the model's language modeling proficiency. This is evident from the less coherent nature of the generated continuations, as opposed to the outcomes from other pruning methods. This observation aligns with the findings presented in the main paper, where both these baselines exhibit the lowest perplexity scores. Overall, FASP demonstrates less bias, compared to other pruning methods, by consistently generating non-toxic content across various groups.

\subsection{Limitations and Ethical Considerations}
Our primary objective revolves around reducing bias in language models through head pruning, targeting the heads that wield the most influence on bias. However, it is important to acknowledge that the same pruning technique can also be manipulated to amplify bias by targeting heads that counteract bias. Our approach also relies on a toxicity detection model to gauge bias, but it is essential to recognize that this model itself might be biased or inaccurate in certain instances.
% An additional limitation of our study is its focus solely on the GPT family.
%However, we have plans to extend this study to a broader range of architectures in future research.
% Although our work focuses on mitigating bias in language models through pruning by pruning the heads are have the most influence on bias, it can be altered to increase bias by pruning the heads that have a negative effect of bias. Our work depends on a toxicity detection model to measure bias, which could contain itself be biased or inaccurate i
\section{Code Appendix}

\subsection{Dataset Pre-processing}
We employed the sentences found within the openly accessible holistic bias dataset\footnote{\url{https://github.com/facebookresearch/ResponsibleNLP/tree/main/holistic_bias}} as our prompts. The dataset encompasses a total of $566$k prompts, covering $13$ distinct social biases. No additional manipulation was performed on the provided instances.
\subsection{Conducting and Analyzing Experiments}
We outline the procedure for executing the code to attain the experimental results in the main paper. Executing these experiments involves evaluating the impact of attention heads on both bias and performance. Subsequently, we carry out a comprehensive comparison involving our proposed technique, FASP, along with all alternative pruning baselines.

\subsubsection{Computing the attention head impact on bias an perplexity}\label{sec:compute_scores}
For the purpose of illustration, the following command is used to assess the impact of excluding attention head number $2$ on gender bias and perplexity. This evaluation is conducted using a GPT-2 model with a seed value of $1$:
 \begin{lstlisting}[language=bash,numbers=none]
python main.py  --model gpt2 --head_knockout 2 --targeted_holistic_bias gender_and_sex --prompting holistic --seed 1
\end{lstlisting}
To account for different attention heads, models, and social biases, the same command could be run while changing the arguments as shown in Table \ref{tab:computing_the_score}.

\label{tab:baselines}
\end{table*}

\subsubsection{Comparing FASP to existing baselines in terms of bias and perplexity:}\label{sec:compute_baselines}

This example  illustrates how to evaluate racial bias in GPT-Neo $1.3$B after pruning using the magnitude-based gradient baseline \cite{NEURIPS2019_2c601ad9} and with a pruning ratio $\alpha$ of $0.04$:
 \begin{lstlisting}[language=bash,numbers=none]
python main.py  --batch_size 128  --model EleutherAI/gpt-neo-1.3B --method mask_gradient_l2_structured --pruned_heads_ratio 0.04 --targeted_holistic_bias race_ethnicity --prompting holistic --seed 1

\end{lstlisting}
To account for different pruning methods, models, and social biases, the same command could be run while changing these arguments as shown in Table \ref{tab:baselines}.







\subsection{Computing Infrastructure}

We conducted our experiments on a single CPU with $25$G RAM for DistilGPT-2 and GPT-2, and $50$G RAM for GPT-Neo $125$M. For GPT-Neo $1.3$B, GPT-J, and Llama $2$, a Tesla P100-PCIE-12GB GPU was utilized. The necessary packages to execute the code are included in our code's $requirements.txt$ file.
