\section{Conclusions}
In this paper, we propose ConcaveQ, a novel non-monotonic value function factorization approach, which goes beyond monotonic mixing functions that are known to have limited representation expressiveness. ConcaveQ employs neural network representations of concave mixing functions. 
An iterative action selection scheme is developed to obtain optimal action during training, while factorized policies using local networks are leveraged to support fully decentralized execution. 
We evaluate the proposed ConcaveQ on predator-prey and StarCraft II tasks. Empirical results demonstrate substantial improvement of ConcaveQ over state-of-the-art MARL algorithms with monotonic factorization.
