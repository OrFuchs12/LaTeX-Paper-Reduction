\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
In this paper, we present PCDNet, the first solution that leverages both RGB intensities and trichromatic angle/degree of linear polarization (AoLP/DoLP) cues for robust car detection in challenging scenarios. PCDNet comprises three key modules: the Polarization Integration (PI) module, the Material Perception (MP) module, and the Cross-Domain Demand Query (CDDQ) module. The PI module fuses AoLP and DoLP to generate a comprehensive and semantically meaningful polarization representation. The MP module explores the polarization/material properties of cars across different learning samples and the CDDQ module proactively integrates RGB features and polarization representations in a request-and-complement manner. Extensive experiments show that PCDNet outperforms existing methods, especially in challenging scenarios. We also introduced a new pixel-aligned RGB-P car detection dataset covering diverse scenarios, which can promote the use of polarization in relevant visual tasks.
