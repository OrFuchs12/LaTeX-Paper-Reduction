Reviewer A:

My last recommendation was that this paper was worth publishing but before that some improvements and fixes were needed. I think that in this revision the authors have improved the paper by giving an answer to the different concerns that were raised, with extra meaningful experiments when needed.  Therefore my recommendation is to accept the paper. 

There were many typos and other writing issues in the previous version, and although most of them have been fixed, few remain and some others have been introduced with the new changes.

I would recommend that the authors do not only fix my spotted issues but that they make a final thorough proofread of the full paper, which apparently was not done.

The errors I have spotted:

- Some 'm' remain that should now be 'k'. Page 2, there is a "m · mu". Page 46, there is a "m · mu".

- Section 1.2 (not fixed from last submission): we demonstrate the flexibility of (out -> our) SAT-BASED solver

- Page 10: there a strong emphasis -> there is a strong emphasis

- Section 4, the second paragraph looks like a mixure of two versions for the same sentence: "[...]- is there a solution of given sum-of-costs xi where the decision problem is whether there is a solution of sum-of-costs xi[...]"

- Page 39: There is a reference to Figure 3 that should be Figure 27.

- Page 41: The explanation of for pattern (i) -> the explanation for pattern (i)

- Page 46, '.' should be replaced by ',' in: "Therefore, if xi_0 + Delta +  delta(Delta) >= mu · k . then [...]". 

- The words "runtimes" and "sum-of-costs" are in boldface in some captions, e.g. Figures 35 and 36, but not in other almost identical captions, e.g. Figures 33 and 34.

- Page 49, after Figure 35:  ECBS [...] outpreform -> outperforms.  PUSH-AND-SWAP produce -> produces

- First line of Section 8:  In this paper, We -> we

- Last paragraph of Section 9: For future, work (remove comma).  Mechanisms that build the encoding and simultaneously checks -> check.

Recommendation: Accept

Reviewer C:

I find this new version easier to read.
The authors explained and highlighted the innovation of this work, and comprehensive extra experiments were carried out.
My remarks were carefully taken into account and the questions have been answered.
Other modifications are insightful.
I recommend to accpet this paper as is.

Recommendation: Accept

Review D

Overall, the paper has improved tremendously, and I think it can be accepted with a last couple of minor revision. I was very happy to see that the paper, and specifically section 4, is much easier to follow, and that its contributions are more clearly now.

The last minor suggestions I have are stated below:


In the process of checking the revisions, I noticed that some parts of the notation was still not completely intuitive to me, so consideration could be given if it might be possible to further improve some aspects.

-p2. The notation for the number of agents was changed from m -> k. However, on that same page, there are two occurrences of 'm' that were not updated. I did not carefully check the rest of the paper, but obviously the authors should.

-p2. why is the makespan 'usually' smaller? (it is always smaller or equal?)

response (Pavel): Added sentence that clarifies this. If the optimal makespan is greater than the optimal sum-of-costs then the inequality would be violated.

-p4. still not clear which are the benchmarks that were not in the original papers?

response (Pavel): We used the same set of benchmark instances as in the original conference papers. However, the experiments done on these benchmark instances have been extended as listed in the paper. In the previous version of the paper, we mentioned that the benchmarks were not reported in the original papers which we could make confusion so now we clarified this issue.

-p11 - explicitly introduce what u__j^t means (not clear in fig. 5)

response (Pavel): Added explanation in the figure caption. The notaiton u_j^t is also explained in the definition 1.

-p11 - 'k' in def. 1 is confusing since this now is the number of agents.

response (Pavel): 

-p11 - it seems that 'i' is the index for the agent. So what is a_i ? Similarly, it is not quite clear why def. 1 needs 'u_j' and 'u_k' rather than just 'j' and 'k' (or u and v perhaps).

response (Pavel): Notation a_i for agents is a convention, means i-th agent, that is, i is a natural number. As the set of vertices is denoted {u_1, u_2, ..., u_n} we rather use index variables like j,l etc. (not i because it is used to index agents and not k because it is reserved for the number of agents) instead of using single letter for u for u_j etc. We carefully checked the convention of letter usage throughout the paper: i - index for agents, k - the number of agents, n - the number of vertices, j,l - indices for vertices.


-p13 - I still think it would be good to already state that a explicit form of the cardinality constraint will be given in C6 a few pages later. As is, the text is still confusing: the section called "Cardinality Constraint for Bounding ξ" does not give an explicit formulation of that constraint.

response (Pavel): Changed the title of the section so it now indicates less that the cardinality constraint is formulated in the section and added a note that the cardinality constraint will be introduced later after we define the Boolean variables that it will bound.

-p18 last paragraph now uses \mu for 'cost' (not makespan) leading to confusion.

response (Pavel): We added an explanation that in this context \mu is the number of expansions and that makespan and sum-of-costs is the same for single agent case.

-p19 - I still have trouble understanding figure 7.
-- don't see how 'extra edges' are indicated in figure 7
-- regarding my earlier comment and response
"-In figure 7, how are the presented MDDs derived from \xi=11? If I am
correct, the figure is showing 3 MDDs: MDD_1^4, MDD_2^2, and MDD_3^5. How are these
costs (4,2,5) derived from 11?
Our response: The costs are derived from the lengths of individual shortest paths which for
a_1 is 4, for a_2 it is 2, and 5 for a_3."
This is still not clear from the text/figure... I think that
--> a. The figure should explicitly state which "MDD i (μ, ξ 0 i )" are shown.
--> b. The text should explain how these are derived from μ 0 , ξ 0 , ∆ such that they indeed can be formed to solve F_MDD (μ 0 , ξ 0 , ∆).
--> c. I now think that the \mu on page 18 was is actually a mistake (it should by ξ_0^i ?)
--> d. but this raises the question of how figure 8 is formed, seems that there "ξ_0^i + 1" is used? (bringing be back to point b).

response (Pavel):
--> a. Specific values of \mu, 'xi_0^i are shown for individual MDDs in figure 7.
--> b. We believe that the meaning of \mu_0, \xi_0 is defined in the paper. However we added explanation that in the single agent case \mu_0 and \xi_0 are the same.
--> c,d. Indicates our important omission how extra and standard edges are distinguished. Not only termination after \xi_0 is required for an extra edge but also when the edge corresponds to the wait action then it is not considered to be an extra edge.


Need to discuss: this points to one undocumented constraint. If an agent leaves the goal then all wait actions before it left must be counted which is not implied by the current set of constraints. So I added the constraint that is needed into the text (C6). It was always present in the implementation but I remember we decided not to mention it in the paper since it is too difficult to understand. Now I think it should be in the text.


The authors indicate that they did perform a spell check, but it seems that they introduced quite a few new ones. Please check spelling and typesetting:
-p11 ' indivudual'
-p12 'also have inter-TEG constrains ensuging'
-p18 last paragraph: "TEG^( "
-p19 "timesteo leg"
-p45 soultions
