\subsection{How to Best Inject Commonsense?}
\label{ablation:qcc}
We evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed enhancement mechanism by comparing it against an alternate configuration that omits the enhancement process and instead concatenates the encoded concept vectors with the text query vectors, treating the resultant feature set as the text query features. Figure \ref{fig:ablation_qcc} shows the relative performance of concatenation \vs enhancement across both \modelname configurations with  300 or 250 seed concepts. We observe that enhancement consistently outperforms concatenation, thereby reinforcing the effectiveness of the enhancement flow in injecting necessary commonsense information. Notably, the concatenation configuration for 300 seed concepts still outperforms the PSVL baseline at various recall thresholds \ie, $k=\{0.3, 0.7\}$. This highlights the capacity of commonsense information to enhance localization performance even with a much simpler injection mechanism.
