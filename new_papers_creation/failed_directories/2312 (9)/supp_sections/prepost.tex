\subsection{When to Perform Commonsense Enhancement?}
\label{ablation:prevpost}
\modelname separately enhances both video and query features prior to the cross-modal fusion step. However, an  alternative option would be to perform commonsense enhancement on the unified video-query features after cross-modal fusion and interaction. Accordingly, we present results for pre-fusion as well as post-fusion enhancement. 
In Figure \ref{tab:ablation_pre_vs_post}, we observe that our approach of pre-fusion enhancement works significantly better than post-fusion enhancement across both 300 and 250 concept sizes. We believe the underlying reason for this observation is consistent with our previous prior findings, where employing separate enhancement modules for video and query features is best suited to inject necessary information and allowed \modelname to differently approach video and query enhancement.
