\begin{abstract}
Temporal knowledge graphs represent temporal facts $(s,p,o,\tau)$ relating a subject $s$ and an object $o$ via a relation label $p$ at time $\tau$, where $\tau$ could be a time point or time interval. Temporal knowledge graphs may exhibit static temporal patterns at distinct points in time and dynamic temporal patterns between different timestamps. 
In order to learn a rich set of static and dynamic temporal patterns and apply them for inference, several embedding approaches have been suggested in the literature.
However, as most of them resort to single underlying embedding spaces, their capability to model all kinds of temporal patterns was severely limited by having to adhere to the geometric property of their one embedding space. 
We lift this limitation by an embedding approach that maps temporal facts into a product space of several heterogeneous geometric subspaces with distinct geometric properties, i.e.\  Complex,  Dual, and  Split-complex spaces. In addition, we propose a temporal-geometric attention mechanism to integrate information from different geometric subspaces conveniently according to the captured relational and temporal information. 
%In addition, we propose two temporal attention mechanisms. The temporal-relational attention mechanism captures various relations with different degrees of temporality. 
%The temporal-geometric attention mechanism fuses information from different geometric subspaces according to the captured relational and temporal information. 
Experimental results on standard temporal benchmark datasets favorably evaluate our approach against state-of-the-art models.

\section{Introduction}
Knowledge Graphs (KGs)~\cite{hogan2021knowledge} model facts in real-world applications as directed edge-labeled graphs. Temporal KGs (TKGs) include timestamps to their facts in order to model the temporal validity of facts. Depending on the representational model, timestamps may represent time points or time intervals. For instance, a quadruple \textit{(Boris Johnson, IsPrimeministerOf, UK, [2019, 2022])} in a TKG represents the fact that Boris Johnson is the prime minister of UK between 2019 and 2022.  
%For example, the fact \textit{(Boris Johnson, IsPrimeministerOf, UK)} is valid only in the interval \textit{[2019,2022]}, which is represented as a quadruple \textit{(Boris Johnson, IsPrimeministerOf, UK, [2019, 2022])} in a TKG.

The development of  Charles is PrinceOfWales to Charles is KingOfEngland is a development over time.}
Relations in temporal knowledge graphs may exhibit various structural temporal patterns. In the left part of Figure \ref{fig:baseMotivExamp}, \textit{(Charles III, marriedWith, Camilla, 2005)} and \textit{(Camilla, marriedWith, Charles III, 2005)} forms a symmetrical structure in time.

We had some parent relationships before. This was a hierarchy (though it can be a DAG). Sure, the parent relationship does not fit so nicely into the set of examples. But rather different examples than wrong ones.}
In the middle part, at first \textit{(Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon, hasChild, Elizabeth II, 1926)} and then \textit{(Elizabeth II, hasChild, Charles III, 1948)}. The transition of \textit{hasChild} relation through \textit{Elizabeth II} forms a hierarchy structure in TKGs.

In the right part, \textit{Charles III}, \textit{Visit} \textit{Malta}, \textit{France, Belgium}, \textit{USA} etc at different timestamps, forming a star structure over time.
%\steffen{The previous sentence previously said `in time'. `in time' means `at the same time'. `over time' means that a development is going on. Nothing to do here now and my remark can be deleted, but this distinction between `in time' and `over time' is important to delineate.}
Moreover, as \textit{Charles III} shows, the structures which entities are involved in temporal knowledge graphs may evolve over time. 
%Moreover, as \textit{Charles III} shows, the structure between entities, in temporal knowledge graphs may evolve over time. 
How to preserve different relational structural patterns and how to capture evolving temporal patterns for entities is a fundamental challenge in TKGEs. 

Existing embedding approaches such as TeRO, RotateQVS, and TLT-KGE\cite{xu2020tero,chen2022rotateqvs,tltcomplexzhang2022along} resorted to single underlying embedding spaces, such as Complex space or Quaternion space to model symmetric patterns by the rotations on a unit hypersphere. Other works \cite{chami2020low,balazevic2019multi,herculemontella2021hyperbolic,han2020dyernie} use hyperbolic space to preserve hierarchical patterns in temporal KGs. However, their capability to model all kinds of structural patterns was severely limited by having to adhere to the geometric properties of their one embedding space. 
\cite{han2020dyernie} has shown the advantage of using multiple geometric subspaces (spherical, hyperbolic, etc) in different dimensions to preserve heterogeneous structural patterns in temporal KGs. However, it ignores the evolution of structural patterns between entities and requires a manual selection of subspaces dimension. How to integrate suitable subsets of geometries to model different relational structural patterns as well as capturing evolutionary temporal patterns between entities remain an open problem in these approaches. 
%How to select suitable subsets of geometries to model different structural patterns of relations as well as capturing evolutionary temporal patterns between entities remain an open problem in these approaches. 
 
%utilizing multiple geometric spaces with attention mechanisms together with the corresponding mathematical operations for both preserving heterogeneous structural temporal patterns and inferring logical temporal patterns have not been yet addressed in the literature. 

In this paper, we address these problems by introducing a new product space covering various geometric subspaces namely a) complex, b) split-complex and c) dual spaces with a \emph{temporal relational attention mechanism} and a \emph{temporal geometric attention mechanism} to model both structural and evolutionary temporal patterns. Figure \ref{fig:baseMotivExamp} illustrates the spaces and some corresponding patterns.
a) Consider the left part of Figure \ref{fig:baseMotivExamp}: 
In the complex space, Euclidean unit circles are induced by circular rotations.
Thus, points on the circle establish periodicities and various logical temporal patterns, e.g.\ relations that are symmetry in time \cite{xu2020tero}. 
Circular rotations are modeled by circular sine and cosine functions in the complex space. 
b) Consider the middle part of Figure \ref{fig:baseMotivExamp}: 
In the split-complex space, a Minkowskian unit circle is induced through hyperbolic rotation, where points on the circle can be mapped using hyperbolic sine and cosine.
%\steffen{The following example is not tied to the example in figure 1. Such mismatch should be avoided}
Thus, the split-complex space can capture a temporal hierarchy, e.g.\ children must be born after their parents.
%as well as certain inferences with logical temporal patterns, e.g.\ grandchildren are the children of children.
%the split-complex space induces a Minkowskian unit circle where the points on the circle can be mapped via hyperbolic rotation represented by hyperbolic sine and cosine to capture hierarchical evolution, besides logical temporal pattern inferences.  
c) Consider the right part of Figure \ref{fig:baseMotivExamp}:
In the dual space, a Galilean unit circle is induced by the rotation that maps points on the circle using Galilean sine and cosine.
Points on the induced circle (two parallel lines) are equidistant to the center, making it useful for modeling star-shaped subgraphs.


The combination of these three spaces together with their geometries and corresponding operators allows for capturing diverse logical and structural patterns such as relational symmetry in time, temporal hierarchy patterns, and temporal star patterns. 
Which geometry should be preferred in a specific case, however, needs to be learned.
For this purpose, we provide a temporal geometric attention mechanism to select the preferred geometries for a given relation and time. 
Moreover, to deal with the evolution of patterns between entities, we propose the temporal-relational attention mechanism to balance static embedding and time-evolving embedding. 
%\steffen{The model name here, HGE, is different from the model name in the title, HGE. This must be consolidated. This happens again in other parts of the paper. Use full text search to correct.}
We compare our TKGE model, heterogeneous geometric embedding (HGE), to TKGE methods in Complex space such as TComplEx \cite{tcomplexlacroix2020tensor}, TeRo \cite{xu2020tero}, TLT-KGE \cite{tltcomplexzhang2022along} and find that our model obtains better results for link prediction tasks in TKGs.
% Our theoretical analysis shows that our model can indeed capture a range of temporal patterns. These theoretical considerations  are  supported by experiments and ablation studies on pre-existing benchmark datasets.
In summary, the key contributions of this paper are as follows:
\begin{itemize}
    \item We extend state-of-the-art Temporal Knowledge Graph Embedding (TKGE) models that use Complex spaces to a new method, HGE. By utilizing multiple heterogeneous geometries, HGE embeds temporal facts in a product space of Complex, Split-complex, and Dual subspaces. 
    \item Our theoretical analysis shows that our embedding method can capture a range of various structural and logical temporal patterns by utilizing the rotation operations acting on  Euclidean, Minkowskian, and Galilean unit circles.
    %\steffen{Circles are not used. Operators are used. I guess what is used are rotation operators in these different spaces. But I am not sure on that.}
    These theoretical considerations are supported by experiments and ablation studies on pre-existing benchmark datasets.
    \item Two novel kinds of attention mechanisms, temporal-relational attention, and temporal-geometric attention allow for representing relation changing frequencies and suitable geometries, respectively.
    %\steffen{Unclear what `degree of temporality' means. I do not understand it. In order to use it, it must be defined}
    \item Experimental results on benchmark datasets show that HGE uniformly improves several state-of-the-art TKGE models. Subsequent ablation studies verify the general benefit of the attention-based product space models over the Complex space.
\end{itemize} 

\section{Preliminaries}
%\subsection{Preliminaries on Temporal Knowledge Graphs}

\begin{definition}[Time Interval]
Let $\Tau$ be the set of closed intervals on the real line $\mathbb{R}$. For a time interval  $\tau=[m,n] \in\Tau, \tau\subseteq \mathbb{R}$, with $m,n\in \tau, m\leq n$ it holds that $\forall t\in \mathbb{R}: m\leq t\leq n\Rightarrow t\in\tau $.
\end{definition}
%as follows:\\ $\tau_1 <  \tau_2 \Leftrightarrow b_1  < a_2$
% albeit we use different symbols to denote them. 
% In particular, we relate two intervals $\tau_1=[a_1,b_1], \tau_2=[a_2,b_2]$ as follows:\\ $\tau_1 <  \tau_2 \Leftrightarrow b_1  < a_2$
% $\tau_1 = \tau_2 \Leftrightarrow b_1  = a_2$\hspace*{1.2cm}
% $\tau_1 \prec \tau_2 \Leftrightarrow a_1 <  a_2 < b_1$.

% We also follow Allen's practice \cite{allen1983maintaining} to denote disjunctive relations between intervals as follows: $\tau_1 \prec\leq \tau_2 \Leftrightarrow (\tau_1 \prec \tau_2\vee \tau_1 < \tau_2 \vee \tau_1 = \tau_2).$

\begin{definition}[Temporal Knowledge Graph]
Let $V$ be a set of vertices, $R$ be a set of relation labels, $\Tau$ be the set of all time intervals,
$G\subseteq V\times R \times V \times \Tau$, then a temporal fact $(s,p,o,\tau)\in G$ with subject $s$, object $o$ and relation label $p$ is valid during time interval $\tau$. A temporal knowledge graph $TKG=(V,R,G)$ defines a set of temporal facts. In addition, 
we denote $G_i$ as $i$-th snapshot of the TKG
\end{definition}

%We use time intervals to represent time information as time intervals  allow for representing time points, but not vice versa. 
We re-use Allen’s interval calculus to express relations between time intervals \cite{allen1983maintaining}. It defines 13 possible relations between two time intervals such that these relations are exhaustive and pairwise disjoint. For example, Allen relation Contains($\tau_1, \tau_2$) holds between two time intervals $\tau_1=[m_1,n_1], \tau_2=[m_2,n_2]$ if $m_1<m_2<n_2<n_1$. Following \cite{singh2023neustip}, we refer to the 13 relations of Allen interval calculus as \textit{Allen relations} and the relation in temporal knowledge graphs as \textit{KG relations}. Appendix A describes the details of 13 Allen relations. 

% \subsection{Complex, Dual, and Split-complex Numbers}
% %In this section, we present the preliminaries required for introducing our model. 
% %\steffen{It is not clear to me what is cited with \cite{harkin2004geometry}\cite{metahelzer2000special}. It seems as if the definition of a product space is cited. But product space needs no citation. What needs a citation are the Dual and Split-complex spaces.}
% We introduce the product space as the base for developing our model in three parts namely Complex, Dual and Split-complex spaces together with their geometric interpretations \cite{harkin2004geometry,metahelzer2000special}.
% Given a quadratic formula $k^2 + g = 0, g = \{-1, 0, 1\}$, we have the three number systems based on the value of $g$:

% \paragraph{\textbf{Complex Numbers}} 
% Complex numbers \cite{harkin2004geometry,metahelzer2000special} allow for solving the quadratic formula $k^2 + 1 = 0,$ by defining a new number $k = i$ where $i^2 = -1$.
% $i$ is used to define the set of Complex numbers $\mathbb{C} = \{p = a + b i | a, b \in \mathbb{R}, i^2 = -1\}$, where $a$ is the real and $b$ the imaginary part. 
% $p^* = a - b i$ is the conjugate of the Complex number $p = a + b i$. 
% %Geometrically, the conjugate is the reflection over the real axis. 
% The addition (subtraction) of the two Complex numbers $p = a + bi$ and $q = c + di$ is $z = p + q = (a + c) + (b + d)i$ $(p - q = (a - c) + (b - d)i).$
% The multiplication of two Complex numbers is defined by $p * q = (ac- bd) + (ad + bc) i.$
% Considering the Euler representation of a Complex number $p = |p| e^{i\theta} = |p| (cos(\theta) + i sin(\theta))$, the point $p$ results from the rotation of the unit number 1 by angle $\theta\in\mathbb{R}$ through multiplication with $e^{i\theta}$, and the scaling by $|p|=s\in\mathbb{R}$ by multiplying it with $s e^{i 0}$.
% The set of all points with the modulus of the size $|p| = 1$ forms a unit circle.

% \paragraph{\textbf{Dual Numbers}} 
% Dual numbers \cite{dualangeles1998application,metahelzer2000special} are  similar to Complex numbers, 
% but their imaginary $\epsilon$ is defined such that $\epsilon^2 = 0, \epsilon \neq 0$.
% %\steffen{This part about the quadratic formulas is broken}
% The dual space is then defined as $\mathbb{D} = \{p = a + b \epsilon | a,b \in \mathbb{R}, \epsilon^2 = 0, \epsilon \neq 0\}$ where $a,b$ are real and dual components of the dual numbers.
% Similarly to the complex numbers, the conjugate of $p$ is defined as $p^* = a - b \epsilon.$
% The addition and subtraction of dual numbers are similar to those of complex numbers. 
% The multiplication of  two dual numbers $p = a + b \epsilon, q = c + d \epsilon$ is defined as $p*q = (ac) + (ad + bc) \epsilon.$ The division is defined as $\frac{p}{q} = \frac{ac + (bc - ad) \epsilon}{c^2}, c \neq 0.$ 
% The length of a dual number is $|p| = |a| = r$.
% The exponential representation of a dual number $p$ is $p = |p| e^{\epsilon \phi}$ where $\phi = \frac{b}{a}$.
% The set $\mathbb{D}_{|p|=1}\{p \in \mathbb{D} | |p| = 1\}$ constitutes the Galilean unit circle on the Dual plane where $e^{\epsilon \phi} = cosg(\phi) + \epsilon sing(\phi)$, and $cosg(.)$ and $sing(.)$ are the Galilean cosine and sine defined as follows
% %\steffen{What follows is not a definition. A definition would allow to compute the result given the theta. But in $cosg(\phi) = \frac{a}{a}$ the theta is not used on the right hand side. Something else is going on here. Also, when I look at figure 1, not only x=1, but also x=-1 is allowed.}
% $cosg(\phi) = \frac{a}{a} = 1$ and $sing(\phi) = \frac{b}{a} = \phi$.
% \paragraph{\textbf{Split-complex Numbers}} 
% Dealing with quadratic formula $k^2 - 1 = 0,$ a split-complex number \cite{harkin2004geometry,metahelzer2000special} is defined as $p = a + j b$, where $j^2 = 1, j \neq 1, -1.$ Formally the space of split-complex number is defined as $\mathbb{S} = \{ p = a + jb | a,b \in \mathbb{R}, j^2 = 1, j \neq 1, -1\}$. $a,b$ are real and split parts, respectively. The addition, subtraction, and conjugate are computed in the same way as for complex numbers. However, the multiplication and division are computed as $p * q = (ac + bd) + (ad + bc) j$, and $\frac{p}{q} = \frac{(ac - bd) + (bc - ad) j}{c^2 - d^2}$, $c^2 - d^2 \neq 0.$ The exponential representation of split-complex numbers is $p = |p| e^{j \theta} = |p| (cosh(\theta) + sinh(\theta) j)$. The split-complex numbers with fixed length constitute a hyperbolic subspace, and split-complex multiplication has commonly been seen as a Lorentz boost of a space-time plane. 
% The Lorentz boost is a mapping in Minkowskian space which can be viewed as a rotation in hyperbolic space.


\section{Embedding Model in Heterogeneous Geometric Subspaces}
To capture heterogeneous structural and logical patterns in a temporal KG, we propose the HGE model which extends the complex space adopted by existing models\cite{tltcomplexzhang2022along, tcomplexlacroix2020tensor} to an attention-based product space. We introduce the key components of our temporal knowledge graph embedding method, HGE, in the following order: 
a) \emph{embedding space},
b) \emph{temporal-relational attention}, 
c) \emph{temporal-geometric attention}. Figure \ref{fig:HGE_model} shows the structure of our proposed HGE model.


\begin{figure*}[t]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{HGE_model.pdf}
    \caption{
An illustration for the HGE. At first, entities, relations and timestamps in temporal knowledge graphs are represented in heterogeneous geometric subspaces: 1) complex space, 2) split-complex space, 3) dual space respectively. Based on the static relation embedding $p_{s}$, and dynamic relation embedding $p_{c}$, temporal relational attention learns hybrid relation embedding $p_{st}$ based on each relation's changing frequencies. Temporal geometric attention incorporates embeddings in geometric subspaces into a product space by $p_{st}$, which decides the suitable geometry for each relation. Finally, the scoring function is performed on the embeddings learned in the product space.  
    }
    \label{fig:HGE_model}
\end{figure*}

\subsection{\textbf{Embeddings in Geometric Subspaces}}
We aim to embed the elements of a temporal knowledge graph (entities, relations, and times) into a $d$ dimensional product space $\mathcal{M} = \mathbb{M}_1 \times \ldots \times \mathbb{M}_d$ where each $\mathbb{M}_i$ is a Complex, Dual or Split-complex space,
i.e.\ $\mathbb{M}_i \in \{ \mathbb{C}, \mathbb{S}, \mathbb{D} \}$.
For a given fact $(s,p,o,\tau)\in G$, we use the mappings $f_e: \mathcal{E} \xrightarrow{} \mathbb{M}_i, f_r: \mathcal{R} \xrightarrow{} \mathbb{M}_i, f_{\tau}: \mathcal{T} \xrightarrow{} \mathbb{M}_i$ to assign $d$ dimensional vectors to each element of a TKG as $\boldsymbol{s_{\mathbb{M}_i},p_{\mathbb{M}_i},o_{\mathbb{M}_i}, \tau_{\mathbb{M}_i}}$ respectively.

%\subsection{Complex, Dual, and Split-complex Numbers}
%In this section, we present the preliminaries required for introducing our model. 
%\steffen{It is not clear to me what is cited with \cite{harkin2004geometry}\cite{metahelzer2000special}. It seems as if the definition of a product space is cited. But product space needs no citation. What needs a citation are the Dual and Split-complex spaces.}
We introduce the three fundamental parts of the product space for developing our model, namely Complex, Split-complex and Dual spaces together with their geometric interpretations.
Given a quadratic formula $k^2 + g = 0, g = \{-1, 1, 0\}$, we have the three number systems based on the value of $g$:

\paragraph{\textbf{Complex Vector Space}} 
Complex numbers \cite{harkin2004geometry,metahelzer2000special} allow for solving the quadratic formula $k^2 + 1 = 0,$ by defining a new number $k = i$ where $i^2 = -1$. 
$i$ is used to define the set of Complex numbers $\mathbb{C} = \{q = a + b i | a, b \in \mathbb{R}, i^2 = -1\}$, where $a$ is the real and $b$ the imaginary part. The multiplication of two Complex numbers $q_1= a+bi, q_2=c+di$ is defined by $q_1 * q_2 = (ac- bd) + (ad + bc) i$. It has been proved by previous works \cite{tltcomplexzhang2022along,tcomplexlacroix2020tensor,xu2020tero} to represent temporal knowledge graphs effectively. Following their work, we represent $\boldsymbol{s,p,o, \tau}$ in complex space as:

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:complex}
\begin{aligned}
        \boldsymbol{s_{\mathbb{C}}}=\boldsymbol{s}_{\mathbb{C}a} + \boldsymbol{s}_{\mathbb{C}b}i, \boldsymbol{p_{\mathbb{C}}}=\boldsymbol{p}_{\mathbb{C}a} + \boldsymbol{p}_{\mathbb{C}b}i,  \\ \boldsymbol{o_{\mathbb{C}}}=\boldsymbol{o}_{\mathbb{C}a} + \boldsymbol{o}_{\mathbb{C}b}i, \boldsymbol{\tau_{\mathbb{C}}}=\boldsymbol{\tau}_{\mathbb{C}a} + \boldsymbol{\tau}_{\mathbb{C}b}i
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

where $\boldsymbol{s}_{\{.\}}, \boldsymbol{p}_{\{.\}}, \boldsymbol{o}_{\{.\}}, \boldsymbol{\tau}_{\{.\}} \in \mathbb{R}^{d}$. ${\{.\}}_{a}$ represents the real part of each element and ${\{.\}}_{b}$ represents the imaginary part.
 
%Geometrically, the conjugate is the reflection over the real axis. 
% The addition (subtraction) of the two Complex numbers $p = a + bi$ and $q = c + di$ is $z = p + q = (a + c) + (b + d)i$ $(p - q = (a - c) + (b - d)i).$
% The multiplication of two Complex numbers is defined by $p * q = (ac- bd) + (ad + bc) i.$
% Considering the Euler representation of a Complex number $p = |p| e^{i\theta} = |p| (cos(\theta) + i sin(\theta))$, the point $p$ results from the rotation of the unit number 1 by angle $\theta\in\mathbb{R}$ through multiplication with $e^{i\theta}$, and the scaling by $|p|=s\in\mathbb{R}$ by multiplying it with $s e^{i 0}$.
% The set of all points with the modulus of the size $|p| = 1$ forms a unit circle.
\paragraph{\textbf{Split-complex Vector Space}} 
Dealing with quadratic formula $k^2 - 1 = 0,$ a split-complex number \cite{harkin2004geometry,metahelzer2000special} is defined as $p = a + j b$, where $k = j, j^2 = 1, j \neq 1, -1.$ Formally the space of split-complex number is defined as $\mathbb{S} = \{ q = a + bj | a,b \in \mathbb{R}, j^2 = 1, j \neq 1, -1\}$. $a,b$ are real and split parts, respectively. The multiplication of two Split-Complex numbers $q_1= a+bj, q_2=c+dj$ is defined by $q_1 * q_2 = (ac+ bd) + (ad + bc) j$. We represent $\boldsymbol{s,p,o, \tau}$ in split-complex space as:

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:split}
\begin{aligned}
        \boldsymbol{s_{\mathbb{S}}}=\boldsymbol{s}_{\mathbb{S}a} + \boldsymbol{s}_{\mathbb{S}b}j, \boldsymbol{p_{\mathbb{S}}}=\boldsymbol{p}_{\mathbb{S}a} + \boldsymbol{p}_{\mathbb{S}b}j,  \\ 
        \boldsymbol{o_{\mathbb{S}}}=\boldsymbol{o}_{\mathbb{S}a} + \boldsymbol{o}_{\mathbb{S}b}j,
        \boldsymbol{\tau_{\mathbb{S}}}=\boldsymbol{\tau}_{\mathbb{S}a} + \boldsymbol{\tau}_{\mathbb{S}b}j,
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

\paragraph{\textbf{Dual Vector Space}} 
Dual numbers \cite{dualangeles1998application,metahelzer2000special} are  similar to Complex numbers, 
but their imaginary $\epsilon$ is defined such that $\epsilon^2 = 0, \epsilon \neq 0$.
%\steffen{This part about the quadratic formulas is broken}
The dual space is then defined as $\mathbb{D} = \{q = a + b \epsilon | a,b \in \mathbb{R}, \epsilon^2 = 0, \epsilon \neq 0\}$ where $a,b$ are real and dual components of the dual numbers. The multiplication of two Dual numbers $q_1= a+b\epsilon, q_2=c+d\epsilon$ is defined by $q_1 * q_2 = (ac) + (ad + bc) \epsilon$. We represent $\boldsymbol{s,p,o, \tau}$ in dual space as:

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:dual}
\begin{aligned}
        \boldsymbol{s_{\mathbb{D}}}=\boldsymbol{s}_{\mathbb{D}a} + \boldsymbol{s}_{\mathbb{D}b}\epsilon, \boldsymbol{p_{\mathbb{D}}}=\boldsymbol{p}_{\mathbb{D}a} + \boldsymbol{p}_{\mathbb{D}b}\epsilon,  \\ \boldsymbol{o_{\mathbb{D}}}=\boldsymbol{o}_{\mathbb{D}a} + \boldsymbol{o}_{\mathbb{D}b}\epsilon, \boldsymbol{\tau_{\mathbb{D}}}=\boldsymbol{\tau}_{\mathbb{D}a} + \boldsymbol{\tau}_{\mathbb{D}b}\epsilon
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}


% The addition and subtraction of dual numbers are similar to those of complex numbers. 
% The multiplication of  two dual numbers $p = a + b \epsilon, q = c + d \epsilon$ is defined as $p*q = (ac) + (ad + bc) \epsilon.$ The division is defined as $\frac{p}{q} = \frac{ac + (bc - ad) \epsilon}{c^2}, c \neq 0.$ 
% The length of a dual number is $|p| = |a| = r$.
% The exponential representation of a dual number $p$ is $p = |p| e^{\epsilon \phi}$ where $\phi = \frac{b}{a}$.
% The set $\mathbb{D}_{|p|=1}\{p \in \mathbb{D} | |p| = 1\}$ constitutes the Galilean unit circle on the Dual plane where $e^{\epsilon \phi} = cosg(\phi) + \epsilon sing(\phi)$, and $cosg(.)$ and $sing(.)$ are the Galilean cosine and sine defined as follows
% %\steffen{What follows is not a definition. A definition would allow to compute the result given the theta. But in $cosg(\phi) = \frac{a}{a}$ the theta is not used on the right hand side. Something else is going on here. Also, when I look at figure 1, not only x=1, but also x=-1 is allowed.}
% $cosg(\phi) = \frac{a}{a} = 1$ and $sing(\phi) = \frac{b}{a} = \phi$.


% The addition, subtraction, and conjugate are computed in the same way as for complex numbers. However, the multiplication and division are computed as $p * q = (ac + bd) + (ad + bc) j$, and $\frac{p}{q} = \frac{(ac - bd) + (bc - ad) j}{c^2 - d^2}$, $c^2 - d^2 \neq 0.$ The exponential representation of split-complex numbers is $p = |p| e^{j \theta} = |p| (cosh(\theta) + sinh(\theta) j)$. The split-complex numbers with fixed length constitute a hyperbolic subspace, and split-complex multiplication has commonly been seen as a Lorentz boost of a space-time plane. 
% The Lorentz boost is a mapping in Minkowskian space which can be viewed as a rotation in hyperbolic space.

\subsection{\textbf{Embeddings in Attention-based Product Space}}
How to fuse information from different subspaces into a product space  efficiently remains a challenging task in the knowledge graph embedding task. Existing work \cite{han2020dyernie} assigns different dimensions $d_{i}$ for each subspace $\mathbb{M}_i$, where $\sum{d_{i}} = d $, and calculates their individual loss which will be aggregated subsequently to a total loss. Such a stacking strategy requires the manual selection of suitable $d_{i}$ numbers for every new task and consumes huge computation resources to reach optimal $d_{i}$ decision. 
To capture suitable geometries from various subspaces efficiently, we introduce an attention-based product space. Rather than stacking ad hoc vectors for each subspace, our method reuses vectors for every subspace and aggregates \textit{Scoring Vectors} of subspaces by relational and temporal information.  

\paragraph{\textbf{Real and Imaginary Vector Sharing}} Existing methods \cite{han2020dyernie} assigns different vectors for each subspaces. However, pre-experiments in Appendix C illustrate that although their geometric interpretations are diverse, real and imaginary vectors in different subspaces are almost unanimous when trained to optimal settings with the same embedding sizes. Accordingly, we share the real and imaginary vectors between all subspaces as follows:

\begin{equation}
    \begin{split}
        &\{.\}_{\mathbb{C}a}=\{.\}_{\mathbb{S}a}=\{.\}_{\mathbb{D}a}\\
        &\{.\}_{\mathbb{C}b}=\{.\}_{\mathbb{S}b}=\{.\}_{\mathbb{D}b}\\
    \end{split}
\end{equation}
where $\{.\} \in \{s, p, o, \tau \}$. With the reusing strategy, our method avoids the manual selection of subspace dimensions and saves embedding space. If not specified, we use $\boldsymbol{s}=[\boldsymbol{s}_{a},\boldsymbol{s}_{b}]$, $\boldsymbol{p}=[\boldsymbol{p}_{a}, \boldsymbol{p}_{b}]$, $\boldsymbol{o}=[\boldsymbol{o}_{a},\boldsymbol{o}_{b}]$ and $\boldsymbol{\tau}=[\boldsymbol{\tau}_{a},\boldsymbol{\tau}_{b}]$ to represent embeddings a generic geometric subspace in the following section for simplicity.
%We use ${\{\boldsymbol{s}/\boldsymbol{p}/\boldsymbol{o}/\boldsymbol{\tau}\}}_{a}, {\{\boldsymbol{s}/\boldsymbol{p}/\boldsymbol{o}/\boldsymbol{\tau}\}}_{b}$ to represent the real and imaginary parts of each element for simplicity. 

\paragraph{\textbf{Temporal-relational Attention}}
Relations in TKGs may exhibit different
%\steffen{`frequencies of change' is more easily understandable than `degrees of temporality'. It would need updating all over the document.}
frequencies of change varying from fully static to quickly changing behavior \cite{tcomplexlacroix2020tensor}. 
For example, the relation \textit{capitalOf} is not changing often over time, while the relation \textit{isPresidentOf} exhibits more frequent changes. 
%\steffen{there is a slight overlap of the index $p$ in $p_d$ with --- wrongly --- $d$ for number of dimensions}
Therefore, for each relation $\boldsymbol{p}$, we provide two vectors $\boldsymbol{p}_s, \boldsymbol{p}_{c} \in \mathcal{M}$. The first captures the static behavior and the second captures the dynamic behavior by multiplication with time embedding $\boldsymbol{\tau}_\tau$. We provide a temporal attention mechanism to emphasize static or dynamic behavior depending on the characteristics of the relation:

\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
    \boldsymbol{p}_{s\tau} &= \alpha_\tau \left(\boldsymbol{p_c} * \boldsymbol{\tau}_\tau\right) + \alpha_s \boldsymbol{p}_s \\ 
    %\label{eq:temporalAttention}
    \left(\alpha_\tau, \alpha_s \right)&=  \operatorname{Softmax}\left(\mathbf{w}_p \left(\boldsymbol{p_c} * \boldsymbol{\tau}_\tau \right) , \mathbf{w}_p \boldsymbol{p}_s \right)
    \label{eq:temporalAttention}
\end{split}
\end{equation}

\noindent
where $\mathbf{w}_p$ is the relation-specific weight.
% Note that in equation\ref{eq:temporalAttention2} \steffen{Do you mean equation \ref{eq:temporalAttention2}? If yes, then say so. `above' is unclear. Furthermore, how does the casting work? I could think of multiple ways of doing that} $\boldsymbol{p_\tau, p_s}$ are vectors in the product space $\mathcal{M}$, so we first cast them to real vectors and then compute the inner product. 
% \steffen{The following is all true, but it does not seem to offer new information, hence I would delete the rest of this paragraph. Moreover, this does also apply to $\boldsymbol{p}_{s}$, because $\boldsymbol{p}_{s}$ is also in $\mathcal{M}$. If you have some so-far hidden assumption about $\boldsymbol{p}_{s}$ this should become revealed.}
% Because $\boldsymbol{p}_{\tau}$ is time-dependent, 
% it can be rewritten as $p_{\tau} = 
% |p_\tau| (cosu(\theta_{\tau}) + k sinu(\theta_{\tau}))$ which can model temporal relations with different frequencies and temporalities. 
% Note that $u \in \{\_, g, h\}$ where $\_, g, h$ represent circular ($k=i$), Galilean ($k=\epsilon$) and Hyperbolic ($k=j$) trigonometry. 


\paragraph{\textbf{Scoring Vectors from Subspaces}} 
We take all values in each subspace for entities, relations, and times
$\boldsymbol{s}_i, \boldsymbol{p}_{s\tau i}, \boldsymbol{o}_i \in \mathbb{M}_i$ and compute $ \boldsymbol{c}_i =  \langle \boldsymbol{s}_i, \boldsymbol{p}_{s\tau i}, {\boldsymbol{o}_i} \rangle$\footnote{Similar to previous work\cite{xu2020tero,lacroix2019tensor}, we adopt conjugate on $\boldsymbol{o}_i$ to increase the performance in experiments.}, where
$\langle , , \rangle$ is the product in Complex, Split-complex and Dual spaces computed as follows:
% \paragraph{Complex Numbers} The multiplication of two Complex numbers $q_1= a+bi, q_2=c+di$ is defined by $q_1 * q_2 = (ac- bd) + (ad + bc) i$.

\section{Theoretical Analysis on Temporal Patterns}
\label{sec:temporal_patterns}
Knowledge graphs exhibit \emph{patterns}. 
A \emph{structural pattern} is a regularity in the graph, e.g.\ a tree as given in the middle of Figure~\ref{fig:baseMotivExamp}, that may or may not allow for logical conclusions, but which may be hard to represent in some embedding methods. 
A \emph{logical pattern} represents a rule that allows for concluding new facts when applied to given facts. For instance, \textit{(Charles,marriedWith,Camilla)} implies
 \textit{(Camilla,marriedWith,Charles)} because \textit{marriedWith} is symmetric. 
 %Symmetry is a logical pattern that cannot be well represented, e.g., in \cite{bordes2013translating}. 
 %The need to express a broad variety of structural and logical patterns has motivated the search for expressive embeddings of static KGs.

Embeddings for temporal knowledge graphs must account for temporal facts including time components and express corresponding \emph{temporal patterns}. 
Four kinds of logical patterns, \emph{symmetric, inverse, asymmetric} and \emph{evolve} are mostly considered and studied in existing TKGE models \cite{chen2022rotateqvs,xu2020tero}. 
However, their definitions either neglect time information or merely consider patterns when facts happen at the same time. 
We generalize and go beyond these approaches and consider \emph{static temporal patterns} and \emph{dynamic temporal patterns}. If a structural or a logical temporal pattern holds \emph{regardless of time information} as in traditional knowledge graphs, we call it a \emph{static temporal pattern}. 
If a structural or a logical temporal pattern represents or draws conclusions \emph{using time information}, we call it a \emph{dynamic temporal pattern}.
% For example, the symmetry of \textit{marriedWith} is a \emph{static logical temporal pattern}. While a wedding starts a marriage and a divorce ends it, the symmetry of the relation \textit{marriedWith} holds at each point in time and does neither imply nor not imply a change over time. 

In the following, we will formally define a few temporal patterns. For simplicity, we only illustrate the occasion when $\tau$ is a time interval. However, it's convenient to extend the following definitions when $\tau$ is a time point. Examples of each definition are indicated after ``//''.
% Though the combinatorics of operators allows for a sheer endless list of temporal patterns,
% we consider such sample definitions important, both  because 
% (i) we can later check for and compare the expressiveness of temporal patterns that were formally defined, and 
% (ii) because we have identified
% issues with regard to their formalizations in \cite{chen2022rotateqvs}.  
% To name but one issue, previous work on temporal knowledge graphs embedding \cite{chen2022rotateqvs,xu2020tero} required for temporal symmetry that a relation between two entities would have to hold from the very beginning to the end of times. \textit{marriedWith} could not be a symmetric relation then, as no one is married before they are even conceived.

\subsection{Modeling Temporal Patterns}
We present a theoretical analysis corresponding to the ability of our method in modeling various temporal patterns introduced in \ref{sec:temporal_patterns} as follows: (See details in Appendix F)
%\steffen{`Theorem's are large and important mathematical constructs. A more modest way of saying we have something formal is to call it a `proposition'}
\begin{proposition}
HGE can model (anti-)symmetry and temporal (anti-)symmetry in Definitions \ref{temporalsym} and \ref{dynamicsym}. 
\label{th1:tempsym}
\end{proposition}

\begin{proposition}
HGE can model inverse and temporal inverse patterns in Definitions \ref{temporalinv} and~\ref{delayedtemporalinv}. 
\label{th1:tempinv}
\end{proposition}

%\steffen{theorem no longer fits the definition}
\begin{proposition}
%Let us assume that relation $p_1$ evolves to relation $p_2$ as formalized in \autoref{evolvepattern}. 
HGE can model evolves pattern in Definition \ref{evolvepattern}. 
\label{th1:tempevolv}
\end{proposition}

\begin{proposition}
%Let $p$ be a temporary relation in time as defined in \autoref{temprelationt1t2}. 
HGE can model temporary relations in Definition \ref{temprelationt1t2}. 
\label{th1:tempevolv}
\end{proposition}


% \begin{theorem}
% HGE can model temporal star structure.
% \label{th1:tempstar}
% \end{theorem}

% \begin{proof}
% In temporal star structure, we have different temporal relations that lead to mapping from same subject entity embedding to different target objects. Therefore, there are assignments to the embedding of entities, relations, and times to hold the star in the vector space.
% \end{proof}




%we aim to embed each entity and relation in the Meta space i.e.,
%$\boldsymbol{s,p,o} \in \mathcal{M} \in \{\mathcal{C}, \mathcal{D}, \mathcal{S}\}.$

\section{Experiments}
% We conduct experiments to evaluate
% HGE's performance on four typical datasets of temporal knowledge graphs. 
%Experiments were set up to answer the following questions.

% \begin{itemize}
%     \item Q1: What's the performance of the proposed HGE on the link prediction task of temporal knowledge graph? %\steffen{I do not understand this sentence}
%         \item Q2: How do temporal-relational attention  and temporal-geometric attention affect the performance of HGE?
%     \item Q3: How do heterogeneous geometric spaces perform on different structural patterns?
%     %\steffen{This was a dangling leftover: performance of HGE?}
%     %\item Q4: How efficient is HGE considering time and space usage?
%     % Q2: How effective is HGE on learning the proposed temporal evolutionary patterns?
    
% \end{itemize}

\subsection{Experimental Settings}
\subsubsection{Dataset}
To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed attention-based product space embedding, 
we perform the link prediction task on four popular temporal knowledge graph benchmark datasets, i.e.\ ICEWS14~\cite{garcia2018learning}, ICEWS05-15~\cite{garcia2018learning}, GDELT~\cite{trivedi2017know} and Wikidata12k~\cite{tcomplexlacroix2020tensor}. ICEWS14 and ICEWS05-15 are two subset datasets from the Integrated Conflict EarlyWarning System (ICEWS)\cite{lautenschlager2015icews}, which contain news facts in 2014 and between 2005 and 2015 respectively. The Global Database of Events, Language, and Tone (GDELT) is a large knowledge graph that describes facts about human behaviors. We adopt the same data subset as \cite{gao2020rotate3d}, which uses the subset of facts from April 1, 2015 to March 31, 2016. Compared to other datasets, GDELT contains fewer temporal relations but more quadruples, which makes it the densest dataset concerning temporal information. Wikidata12k is a subset of wikidata dump \cite{erxleben2014introducing}. It represents the time information $\tau \in \mathcal{T}$ as time intervals, in which $m$ or $n$ could be empty, referring to intervals $(-\infty,n]$ or $[m,\infty)$.  
Table 5 summarises the statistics of four datasets.

% % YAGO11k is constructed from the large-scale knowledge graph YAGO3 \cite{mahdisoltani2014yago3}. It represents the time information $\tau \in \mathcal{T}$ as time intervals.  xxx(how to deal with intervals, check framework)

% The Global Database of Events, Language, and Tone (GDELT) is a large knowledge graph that describes facts about human behaviors. We adopt the same data subset as \cite{gao2020rotate3d}, which uses the subset of facts from April 1, 2015 to March 31, 2016. Compared to other datasets, GDELT contains fewer temporal relations but more quadruples, which makes it the densest dataset concerning temporal information. 

% Wikidata12k is a subset of wikidata dump\cite{erxleben2014introducing}. It represents the time information $\tau \in \mathcal{T}$ as time intervals, in which $a$ or $b$ could be empty, referring to intervals $(-\infty,b]$ or $[a,\infty)$. 
% \steffen{entities cannot be temporal. Only triples can be temporal in our TKG model (section 2). Furthermore: in wikidta, there are 7M triples, but only 1726 triples with time stamps? I.e. there is almost no temporal information?}
% We adopt the same experiment setting as \cite{lacroix2019tensor}. At train and test time, for a given $(s,p,o,[a,b])\in E$, we sample a timestamp (appearing in the dataset) uniformly at random, in the range $[a,b]$. When $a$ or $b$ is empty, we set it as the boundary timestamp.


%\steffen{Backbone models cannot be part of `experimental settings'. They could be part of an `Implementation' section. Do they also function as baseline models?}
\subsubsection{Backbone and Baseline Models}
Our proposed model, HGE, aims to generalize complex-space-based TKGE models to an attention-based product space of heterogeneous geometric subspaces. Hence, we choose several state-of-the-art complex-space-based TKGE models as HGE's backbone models to validate its effectiveness. \textbf{TeRo} \cite{xu2020tero} defines the evolution of entity embeddings from the initial state to the current time as a rotation in complex vector space. \textbf{TComplEx} and \textbf{TNTComplEx} \cite{tcomplexlacroix2020tensor} models temporal knowledge graph completion as an order 4 tensor completion problem. \textbf{TLT-KGE} \cite{tltcomplexzhang2022along} models semantic
information and temporal information as different parts of complex space or quaternion space. 
Complex or quaternion operations exchange information between different
parts.
%TComplEx incorporates time information by the multiplication between relation embedding and time embedding. As some relations might not change quickly over time, TNTComplEx augments the temporal relation embedding in TComplEx with an additional non-temporal relation embedding part.   



To give a comprehensive overview, we also compare our model with non-complex space temporal knowledge graph embedding baselines TTransE \cite{garcia2018learning},  TA-DistMult \cite{leblay2018deriving}, RotateQVS\cite{chen2022rotateqvs}, BoxTE \cite{messner2022temporal}, and LCGE\cite{niu2022logic}\footnote{We notice some inconsistent inference issues in LCGE's original code. Please refer to Appendix J for detailed discussions.}.

% We choose TeRo \cite{xu2020tero}, T(NT)ComplEx \cite{tcomplexlacroix2020tensor} and TLT-KGE(complex) \cite{tltcomplexzhang2022along} as complex space temporal knowledge graph embedding backbone models. Our proposed method aims to generalize them from complex space to product space. To keep the parameters the same, we only consider the temporal-geometric attention mechanism for TeRo and TComplEx as they only use $p_{s}$. Both the temporal-relational attention mechanism and temporal-geometric attention mechanism are used for TNTComplEx and TLT-KGE. To give a comprehensive overview, we also compare our model with non-complex space temporal knowledge graph embedding baselines TTransE \cite{garcia2018learning},  TA-DistMult \cite{leblay2018deriving}, RotateQVS\cite{chen2022rotateqvs} and BoxTE \cite{messner2022temporal}\footnote{We do not choose DyERNIE\cite{han2020dyernie} as the baseline model for 2 reasons: a). The original code of DyERNIE-product model will report errors during training. b). DyERNIE works on low-dimensional TKGE and adopts a time-unaware filtering strategy.}.

\subsubsection{Evaluation Metrics}
We adopt the link prediction task to evaluate our proposed model. Link prediction infers the missing entities for incomplete facts. 
During the test step, we follow the procedure of \cite{xu2020tero} to generate candidate quadruples. From a test quadruple $(s,p,o, \tau)$, we replace $s$ with $\bar{s} \in \mathcal{E}$ and $o$ with $\bar{o} \in \mathcal{E}$ to get candidate quadruples $(s,p,\bar{o}, \tau) \cup (\bar{s},p,o, \tau)$.  If $\tau$ is a time interval $[m,n]$, we sample a time point (appearing in the dataset) uniformly at random, in the range $[m,n]$ as \cite{lacroix2019tensor}. When $m$ or $n$ is empty, we set it as the first or last time point of the dataset. All candidate quadruples will be ranked by their scores using a time-aware filtering strategy \cite{goel2020diachronic}. We evaluate our models with four metrics: Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR), the mean of the reciprocals of predicted ranks of correct quadruples, and Hits@(1/3/10), the percentage of ranks not higher than 1/3/10. For all experiments, the higher the better. 

% \subsubsection{Implementation Details} \steffen{I do not understand from this description, whether all models had similar number of parameters. It would be good to say what we aim to achieve with dimension settings}
To have a fair comparison, we set entity and relation embedding dimension sizes as reported in the original papers. For TeRo-based models, we set the dimension size of $d$ as 500 on four benchmark datasets. For TComplEx-based, TNTComplEx-based, and TLT-KGE-based models, we set the dimension size of $d$ as 1200, 1200, 1500 and 2000 on ICEWS14, ICEWS05-15, GDELT and Wikidata12k respectively. The training epoch is set to 200. We adopt the same regularizer, loss function, and negative sampling size as reported in the original papers\footnote{The code, details of training and appendix are provided in \url{https://github.com/NacyNiko/HGE}}. 
%For TeRo-based models, we adopt N3 regularizer \cite{lacroix2018canonical} and set the weight to 0.05. We set the negative sampling size to 10 and adopt the log loss function as the original paper does. For T(NT)ComplEx-based, and TLT-KGE-based models, we use a full negative sampling strategy and the cross entropy loss function. 
%We adopt N3 regularizer for entity and relation embedding and Lambda3 regularizer \cite{tcomplexlacroix2020tensor} for time embedding.

\subsection{HGE's Performance Comparison}
%\subsection{HGE's Performance Comparison(RQ1)}
%We answer RQ1 by comparing HGE's performance gain on timestamp-type datasets and time interval-type datasets. 
We evaluate HGE's performance gain on four datasets. Table \ref{tbl:LinkPredictionResults} shows the performances of the original backbones and backbones plugged with HGE on time point datasets ICEWS14, ICEWS05-15, and GDELT. From Table \ref{tbl:LinkPredictionResults}, we have the following observations:

(i) HGE can provide significant improvements over chosen backbones consistently on all datasets, which verifies the effectiveness of the proposed HGE module. 

(ii) We observe the proposed method is more effective on the dense dataset GDELT. GDELT provides more instances for each relation-timestamp pair. We conjecture it benefits the temporal-geometric attention mechanism, in which fine-grained geometric attention is influenced by both relational and temporal information. Conversely, ICEWS05-15 is the sparsest dataset. As a result, HGE dose not greatly improve the performance of backbones on ICEWS05-15 and even decreases TeRo's performance.  

(iii) We find that HGE achieves greater performance gains for TNTComplEx and TComplEx than for TLT-KGE. As the TLT-KGE model provides interactions between time information and relation information in complex numbers, we believe it substitutes the function of the temporal-relation attention mechanism to some degree. However, Table 7 in Appendix  presents that TNTComplEx+HGE reaches comparable results as TLT-KGE with only half parameter numbers, which demonstrates the proposed temporal-relation attention mechanism is more efficient to combine time and relation information.
 

Table \ref{table:wikidata} shows link prediction results on the time interval dataset. With HGE, all metrics get improvement, reflecting HGE could boost the performance of backbones on different kinds of TKGs.
% \steffen{why does Table 4 not state results for TLT-KGE. This seemed to achieve best results of the pure backbones in Table 3.}

\end{table}

\subsection{Ablation Study}
We conduct ablation study experiments on backbone TNTComplEx to investigate the effectiveness of each component. From Table \ref{table:ablation_tga}, we have the following observations:

% (i) Generally, the proposed HGE model outperforms the variants with merely one kind of attention mechanism, which shows that both two attention mechanisms have a positive impact on temporal knowledge graph completion tasks.

(i) Our proposed subspace integration strategy achieves higher performance than the stacking strategy introduced by \cite{han2020dyernie}. We find out individual loss for each subspace in TNTComplEx+stack becomes unbalanced during training time. We conjecture the model may pay too much attention to optimizing the unsuitable geometry subspaces for certain facts and hamper further improvement. 

(ii) We observe that the temporal-relation attention mechanism contributes more performance gain on GDELT. GDELT is a dense dataset and has more facts for the enumeration of objects of relation types and timestamps than other datasets. We conjecture it benefits from the fine-grained geometric attention mechanism in which the attention weights are influenced by both relation type and timestamps. 

(iii) We find that the temporal-geometric attention mechanism is more effective on ICEWS14 and ICEWS05-15 datasets. Compared to GDELT, they contain more relation types and thus provide a wider variety of relational structural patterns in the datasets. This illustrates the importance of introducing heterogeneous geometric spaces in HGE to represent the diverse structure in temporal knowledge graphs.

\subsection{Case Study}
\textit{Intent to cooperate} relation forms a temporal-star structure in TKGs as the head entity could express this attitude to multiple tail entities. In Figure \ref{fig:case_study}, on account of the query (Barack Obama, intent to cooperate, ?, 153), complex space predicts the wrong answer \textit{Angela Merkel} as it supposes a symmetric instance exists for \textit{(Angela Merkel, $r_1$, Barack Obama, 105)}. Split-complex space predicts the wrong answer \textit{Japan} to form a hierarchy path between \textit{Angela Merkel, Barack Obama} and \textit{Japan}. Dual space predicts the correct answer \textit{Poland} as it has been the object entity in the temporal star structure formed by \textit{France}. Given that \textit{Barack Obama} consults \textit{Japan} recently, HGE chooses the correct answer \textit{Poland} with the help of the temporal-geometric attention mechanism.

% \subsection{Static Knowledge Graph Embedding}
% Symmetric, antisymmetric, and inverse patterns are frequently studied by static knowledge graph embedding models.
% %Static knowledge graph embedding models can be roughly divided into two types. 
% % \emph{Transformation-based models} aim at minimizing the distance between relation-specific transformed subject vectors and object vectors. 
% % %Translation \cite{bordes2013translating} and rotation \cite{sun2018rotate} are popular transformation functions that can accomodate few relation patterns in static KGs. 
% TransE\cite{bordes2013translating} can model antisymmetric, inverse, and composition patterns by translation transformation, but it cannot infer symmetric patterns.  RotatE \cite{sun2018rotate} models relation as rotation to infer symmetric, antisymmetric, inverse, and composition patterns.
% % %Among the first, TransE \cite{bordes2013translating} 
% % %measures distance in Euclidean space between the vector representation of an object entity $o$ and the sum of vector representations of subject entity $s$ and relation $r$ to judge whether a fact $(s,r,o)$ holds.
% % %Later works \cite{lin2015learning,wang2014knowledge} tackle its deficiencies when learning $1:N, N:1$ and $N:N$ relations by using more complicated and representationally expressive transformation methods. 
% % %RotatE \cite{sun2018rotate} defines the relation as the rotation from subject to object entities using element-wise Hadamard product. 
% % % Rotate3D \cite{gao2020rotate3d} represents relations as rotations in three-dimensional space to model non-commutative composition patterns for multi-hop reasoning.
% AttH \cite{chami2020low} utilize rotation and reflection in hyperbolic spaces to preserve hierarchical structural patterns in addition to inferring logical patterns.

% % \emph{Semantic matching models} capture semantic similarities between entities by tensor factorization. DistMult \cite{yang2015embedding} uses a bilinear function to calculate the similarity score. This model is inherently symmetric, but it is incapable of modeling anti-symmetry.
% % Later work ComplEx \cite{trouillon2016complex} and QuatE \cite{zhang2019quaternion} extend the model to complex and quaternion spaces respectively to model symmetric and anti-symmetric patterns. 
% % DualE \cite{cao2021dual} combines dual vector with Quaternion space but does not discuss a generalized product space representation. \cite{gregucci2023link} combines the query representations from \textit{transformation-based models} and \textit{Semantic matching models} by attention mechanism. In this way, the most suitable model could be selected to answer each query.

% % All the above-reviewed models study patterns in static KGs by using a single space. \cite{mixedgu2018learning} studies preserving structural patterns in the Cartesian product of several spaces namely Euclidean, hyperbolic, and sphere in static KG. However, we plan to use multiple geometric spaces to model both temporal structural and logical patterns in TKGs.

% %\steffen{The idea of using product spaces is not new in general. was there not at least one paper that did it for static embeddings?}

%\steffen{The reader does not benefit from the next sentence. Either he knows it already - then he does not need to read the sentence. If he does not know it then `temporal relation' is not a self-explaining term. I have no clue what it means. Maybe it is not necessary to understand it here in detail, but then I would talk about it only at a level that the reader needs to understand.}
% \steffen{Don't talk about popularity. Popularity is not science}
%Temporal knowledge graph embedding gains its popularity in recent years. 
%\subsection{Temporal Knowledge Graph Embedding}
TKGE models incorporate time information in different ways.
TTransE \cite{leblay2018deriving} and TA-DistMult \cite{garcia2018learning} insert the time information into different score functions as another element. 
TeRo \cite{xu2020tero} defines the temporal evolution of entity embeddings as a rotation from the initial time to the current time in complex vector space.
%It study patterns, such as temporary relation, asymmetry, and reflexivity.

% new topic, new paragraph
T(NT)ComplEx \cite{lacroix2019tensor} is a semantic matching approach that models temporal knowledge graph completion as an order 4 tensor completion problem. 
%It proposes a novel regularization that favors the slow evolution of timestamp representations over time.
TeLM \cite{xu2021temporal} also performs 4th-order tensor factorization on temporal knowledge graphs but adds a bias component between the neighboring temporal embeddings in the temporal regularizer. Moreover, it adopts multivector embeddings for entities, relations, and timestamps.

Inspired by TeRo \cite{xu2020tero}, RotateQVS \cite{chen2022rotateqvs} embeds entities in quaternion space and temporal changes are represented as rotations.
BoxTE \cite{messner2022temporal} extends BoxE \cite{abboud2020boxe} by including  relation-specific time embeddings.
TLT-KGE \cite{tltcomplexzhang2022along} models semantic information and temporal information as different parts of complex space or quaternion space. Complex or quaternion operations exchange information between different parts. 
LCGE \cite{niu2022logic} use temporal rules to regularize entity embedding and adopts commonsense reasoning as the extra learning task. Most of the reviewed TKGE approaches model temporal patterns by using a single geometry, and do not present multiple geometries to capture diverse temporal patterns. 
%Besides, they study temporal logical patterns and overlook temporal structural patterns such as temporal hierarchy.


Several manifold-based TKGE models have been proposed in \cite{herculemontella2021hyperbolic,han2020dyernie}.
\cite{herculemontella2021hyperbolic} is an extension of AttH \cite{chami2020low} to temporal KGEs which use hyperbolic manifolds as embedding space. It only uses a single geometry for embedding space.
%This model uses a single geometry rather than the multiple geometries we adopted to model multiple structural patterns.
\cite{han2020dyernie} embeds TKGs into a product space of several manifolds to model multiple structural patterns. However, it does not select the most suitable manifold depending on structural patterns existing in TKGs but chooses it manually.
%In addition, it ignores modeling temporal logical patterns by taking advantage of rotations in Euclidean and hyperbolic space. 

%\steffen{The subclause is not `although' the main clause. These are two logically disconnected proposition}

%\steffen{The following sentence is interesting, but it is also incomprehensible as `temporal logical patterns' and `temporal structural patterns' were never defined. This would be a good thing to do in the introduction. Include a table of examples!}


\section{Conclusion}
We present HGE, a new temporal KGE model that utilizes multiple geometries. HGE extends state-of-the-art TKGEs from a Complex space to the product space that embeds temporal facts in Complex, Split-complex, and Dual subspaces via two temporal attention mechanisms. The temporal-relational attention mechanism captures relations with varying change frequencies. The temporal geometric attention mechanism fuses information from different geometries according to the captured relational and temporal information. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets validate that our model uniformly improves several state-of-the-art Complex-based TKGE models. In the future, we plan to include more types of heterogeneous geometric spaces.

\section{Extending Backbones to HGE methods}
\paragraph{TeRo}
TeRo \cite{xu2020tero} represents $\boldsymbol{s,p,o, \tau}$ in Complex space as Equation \ref{eq:complex}. Similarly, we represent $\boldsymbol{s,p,o, \tau}$ in Split-complex space and Dual space as Equation \ref{eq:split} and \ref{eq:dual}. Following \cite{xu2020tero}, we represent $\boldsymbol{s}_{t}$ and $\boldsymbol{o}_{t}$ as:
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
        \boldsymbol{s_{t}}_{\mathbb{M}_{i}}= \boldsymbol{s}_{\mathbb{M}_{i}} \circ \boldsymbol{t}_{\mathbb{M}_{i}}, 
                \boldsymbol{o_{t}}_{\mathbb{M}_{i}}= \boldsymbol{o}_{\mathbb{M}_{i}} \circ \boldsymbol{t}_{\mathbb{M}_{i}}
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
For temporal relational attention, we set $\boldsymbol{p} = \boldsymbol{p}_{s} = \boldsymbol{p}_{c}$, so the dynamic relational information is captured by $\boldsymbol{p}*\boldsymbol{t}$.

\paragraph{TLT-KGE}
TLT-KGE \cite{tltcomplexzhang2022along} represents $\boldsymbol{s,p,o, \tau}$ in Complex space as:
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
        \boldsymbol{s_{\mathbb{C}}}=\boldsymbol{e}_{s} + \boldsymbol{t}_{\tau}^{e}i, \boldsymbol{p_{\mathbb{C}}}=\boldsymbol{r}_{p} + \boldsymbol{t}_{\tau}^{r}i,  \boldsymbol{o_{\mathbb{C}}}=\boldsymbol{e}_{o} + \boldsymbol{t}_{\tau}^{e}i, %\boldsymbol{\tau_{\mathbb{C}}}=\boldsymbol{\tau}_{a} + \boldsymbol{\tau}_{b}i
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
Similarly, we represent $\boldsymbol{s,p,o, \tau}$ in Dual space and Split-complex space as:
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
        \boldsymbol{s_{\mathbb{D}}}=\boldsymbol{e}_{s} + \boldsymbol{t}_{\tau}^{e}\epsilon, \boldsymbol{p_{\mathbb{C}}}=\boldsymbol{r}_{p} + \boldsymbol{t}_{\tau}^{r}\epsilon,  \boldsymbol{o_{\mathbb{C}}}=\boldsymbol{e}_{o} + \boldsymbol{t}_{\tau}^{e}\epsilon, \\
        %\boldsymbol{\tau_{\mathbb{C}}}=\boldsymbol{\tau}_{a} + \boldsymbol{\tau}_{b}i
        \boldsymbol{s_{\mathbb{S}}}=\boldsymbol{e}_{s} + \boldsymbol{t}_{\tau}^{e}j, \boldsymbol{p_{\mathbb{S}}}=\boldsymbol{r}_{p} + \boldsymbol{t}_{\tau}^{r}j,  \boldsymbol{o_{\mathbb{S}}}=\boldsymbol{e}_{o} + \boldsymbol{t}_{\tau}^{e}j, 
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
For temporal relational attention, we adopt $\boldsymbol{r_{p}}$ and $\boldsymbol{r_{compr}}$ in Equation 12 of original paper as  $\boldsymbol{p}_{s}$, and $\boldsymbol{p}_{c}*\boldsymbol{\tau}_{\tau}$ respectively, where $\boldsymbol{r_{compr}}$ = $\boldsymbol{r_{p}}$ *  $\boldsymbol{t_{compr}}$.  

\section{Embeddings in Complex, Dual and Split-Complex Subpaces}
\label{sec:embeddings_subspaces}
Keeping other settings fixed, we train 3 model variants TNTComplEx+complex, TNTComplEx+split, TNTComplEx+dual which use a single geometric space to optimal MRR scores on ICEWS14. We randomly select 100 entities from the entity set and analyze the similarity of their embeddings on different geometric spaces by cosine similarity:

\begin{equation}
S_C(A, B)=\frac{\mathbf{A} \cdot \mathbf{B}}{\|\mathbf{A}\|\|\mathbf{B}\|}=\frac{\sum_{i=1}^n A_i B_i}{\sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^n A_i^2 \cdot \sum_{i=1}^n B_i^2}}
\end{equation}

We concat the real part and imaginary part of one entity when calculating the cosine similarity. From Figure \ref{fig:cosine_similarity}, we could find out that in every sub-graph, the values on the diagonal, which represent the cosine similarity between entity embeddings of the same entity on different geometric subspace, are always the highest in a row and exceed 0.95. Therefore, although their geometric interpretations are diverse, real and imaginary vectors in different subspaces are almost unanimous when trained to optimal settings.

\section{Modeling Various Temporal Patterns}
\label{temporal_pattern_proof}

 \begin{proposition}
HGE can model (anti-)symmetry patterns introduced in Definitions \ref{temporalsym} and \ref{dynamicsym}.
\label{th1:tempsym}
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
Let $p$ be a relation with temporal symmetry.
One condition for modeling this pattern is $S(s,p,\bar{o},\tau) =  S(o,p,\bar{s},\tau).$  For simplicity of representation, we use $p_t = p_{s\tau}.$
Without loss of generality, we assume that we have only a one-dimensional split-complex vector. Therefore, we have the following equality to fulfill temporal symmetry:
\begin{equation*}
\begin{split}
    &\big( s_a p_{ta} o_{a} + s_b p_{tb} o_{a} - s_a p_{tb} o_{b} - s_b p_{ta} o_{b}\big) = \\
    &\big( o_a p_{ta} s_{a} + o_b p_{tb} s_{a} - o_a p_{tb} s_{b} - o_b p_{ta} s_{b} \big).
\end{split}
\end{equation*}
This leads to the following equality $s_b p_{tb} o_{a} = s_a p_{tb} o_{b}.$
To hold this equality, we need to have either $p_{tb} = 0$ or $s_b o_{a} = s_a o_{b}$. 
%\steffen{I still do not understand the following sentence. You have commented out this comment, but it still puzzles me completely.}
So far, we show for a given grounded quadruple $(s,p,o,\tau)$, 
if our model learns $(s,p,o,\tau)$ to be true, it can also hold its temporal symmetry $(o,p,s,\tau)$ as true. 
To generalize this to the universal quantifier (every grounded quadruple),
we can add one extra dimension to model temporal symmetry for the extra pair of entities. In the extended dimension for the new pair (s,o), we should have $p_{tb} = 0$ or $s_b o_{a} = s_a o_{b}$ to hold temporal symmetry. In this way, all pairs $(s,o)$ which are connected by temporal symmetry relation will be held as true by the model.
A similar procedure can be done for Dual and ComplEx spaces. Therefore, there exist assignments for embeddings of entities and relations that fulfill the encoding of the temporal symmetric pattern. 
\end{proof}

\begin{proposition}
HGE can model inverse patterns introduced in Definitions \ref{temporalinv} and~\ref{delayedtemporalinv}.
\label{th1:tempinv}
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
Let temporal relation $p_1$ be the inverse of the temporal relation $p_2$ at all time points (\ref{temporalinv}).
One condition to model this pattern is to fulfill $S(s,p_1,\bar{o},\tau) =  S(o,p_2,\bar{s},\tau).$
Without loss of generality, we assume that we have only a one-dimensional split-complex vector. 
Therefore, we have the following equality to fulfill temporal inverse relationships:
\begin{equation*}
\begin{split}
    &\big( s_a p_{1ta} o_{a} + s_b p_{1tb} o_{a} - s_a p_{1tb} o_{b} - s_b p_{1ta} o_{b}\big) = \\
    &\big( o_a p_{2ta} s_{a} + o_b p_{2tb} s_{a} - o_a p_{2tb} s_{b} - o_b p_{2ta} s_{b} \big).
\end{split}
\end{equation*}
If we set $p_{1ta}  = p_{2ta},\,\,\, p_{1tb}  = -p_{2tb}$, the above equality holds. This means there exist assignments for embeddings of entities, relations, and times that fulfill the encoding of temporal inverse patterns. 
Our proof can be generalized to $d$ dimensional product space by adding one dimension per each grounded atom. For the pattern in \ref{delayedtemporalinv}, the proof procedes likewise. 
The only difference is that the time embedding will be different at the two times $\tau_1, \tau_2$ to hold $p_{1ta}  = p_{2ta},\,\,\, p_{1tb}  = -p_{2tb}$. 
%\steffen{I do not understand the following sentence. But aside from this, the proof looks ok}
%One way is to set the real parts of the two times embedding the same, and the imaginary parts to be negative of each other.
\end{proof}

%\steffen{theorem no longer fits the definition}
\begin{proposition}
Let us assume that relation $p_1$ evolve to relation $p_2$ as formalized in \ref{evolvepattern}. HGE can model this pattern.
\label{th1:tempevolv}
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
Given that $p_1$ evolves to $p_2$, and also given 
the two times $\tau_1$ and $\tau_2$ with $\tau_1 \prec\leq \tau_2$,
%\steffen{`with condition mentioned in' --- a proof is never written like this. The condition is set forward in the proof.}
%one possible condition \steffen{Is `condition' not a wrong word here?} 
to model the pattern, we need to have $S(s,p_1,\bar{o},\tau_1) =  S(s,p_2,\bar{o},\tau_2).$
Without loss of generality, we assume that we have only a one-dimensional split-complex vector. Then, we must fulfill the following equality:
\begin{align*}
    \big( s_a p_{1t_1a} o_{a} + s_b p_{1t_1b} o_{a} - s_a p_{1t_1b} o_{b} - s_b p_{1t_1a} o_{b}\big) =  \\
    \big( s_a p_{2t_2a} o_{a} + s_b p_{2t_2b} o_{a} - s_a p_{2t_2b} o_{b} - s_b p_{2t_2a} o_{b}\big).
\end{align*}
For this equality to hold, it must be the case that  $p_{1t_1a} = p_{2t_2a},\,\,\, p_{1t_1b} = p_{2t_2b}$. Note that these equality conditions do not necessarily mean that the embedding of static and temporal relations in Equation \ref{eq:temporalAttention} should be the same because different convex combinations can create the same vector for temporal relations. Considering the  universal quantifier, we can add one extra dimension for each grounded atom to fulfill equality. 
A similar consideration can be applied to Dual and ComplEx spaces. Therefore, there exist assignments for embeddings of entities and relations that encode the patterns.
\end{proof}

%\steffen{theorem no longer fits the definition}
\begin{proposition}
Let $p$ be a temporary relation in time as defined in \ref{temprelationt1t2}. HGE can model this relation.
\label{th1:tempevolv}
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
Let $p$ be a temporary relation as in \ref{temprelationt1t2}.
To follow this pattern in the embedding space, for a given grounded atom $(s,p,o,\tau_1)$, there exist $\tau_0, \tau_2$ and also the embedding vectors for $s, p, o, \tau_0, \tau_1, \tau_2$ such that we have $S(s,p,\bar{o},\tau_1) \neq  S(s,p,\bar{o},\tau_2)$ and $S(s,p,\bar{o},\tau_1) \neq  S(s,p,\bar{o},\tau_0)$ as one possible condition to fulfill the pattern.
Similar to the previous proofs, 
let us assume that we have only 
a one-dimensional split-complex vector. 
To fulfill the first condition (the second one will be similar), we have
\begin{align*}
    \big( s_a p_{t_1a} o_{a} + s_b p_{t_1b} o_{a} - s_a p_{t_1b} o_{b} - s_b p_{t_1a} o_{b}\big) \neq  \\
    \big( s_a p_{t_2a} o_{a} + s_b p_{t_2b} o_{a} - s_a p_{t_2b} o_{b} - s_b p_{t_2a} o_{b}\big).
\end{align*}
This can be simply fulfilled if we set $p_{t_1a} \neq p_{t_2a}, p_{t_1b} \neq p_{t_2b}$.
In addition, we can have a large value for $S(s,p,\bar{o},\tau_1)$ and a small value for $S(s,p,\bar{o},\tau_2)$ (or vice versa) by properly setting the temporal relation close to zero at time $\tau_1$ and high value at time $\tau_2$ (and vice versa).
A similar calculation can be done for Dual and ComplEx spaces. 
Therefore, there exist assignments for embeddings of entities and relations that  encode the pattern.
\end{proof}





\section{Experiment Details}
All experiments in the paper were run on the same NVIDIA A100 GPU device(40G GPU/100G CPU) with Ubuntu system 22.0. We implement a grid search to select the best regularizer weight from [5e-4, 3e-3, 5e-3, 3e-3, 1e-3, 3e-2, 1e-2, 1e-1]. A detailed list of hyperparamters is provided in hyperparamter.pdf file in the code folder of supplement material.

\section{Temporal Structural Patterns on Geometric subspaces}
We consider symmetric patterns belonging to structural patterns too and define two other types of temporal structural patterns:
\begin{definition}
Relation $p$ forms a temporal star of size $n\in\mathbb{N}$\\
iff $\forall s: \exists o_1,\tau_1 \ldots, 
 o_n, \tau_n: Precedes(\tau_1, \tau_2) \And \ldots \And Precedes(\tau_(n-1), \tau_n) \And (s,p, o_1, \tau_1) \And (s,p, o_2, \tau_2) \And \ldots \And (s,p, o_n, \tau_n)$. 
\end{definition}

\label{sec:structural_pattern_analysis}
\begin{definition}\label{temphierarchy}
A relation $p$ forms a temporal hierarchy iff $\forall v_1, v_2, v_3, \tau_1, \tau_2: (v_1,p,v_2,\tau_1)\And (v_2,p,v_3,\tau_2) \rightarrow \tau_1 \prec \tau_2 
$ 
\end{definition}


% \steffen{Check that names of patterns are identical to definitions}
We investigate if heterogeneous geometric subspaces could represent different kinds of structural patterns. We extract 3 subsets for static symmetry, temporal hierarchy, and temporal star structural patterns from the test set of ICEWS14 and ICEWS05-15. Four variants of TNTComplEx+HGE model are tested in these subsets: 1) complex: only complex space is used. 2) split-complex: only split-complex space is used. 3) dual: only dual space is used. 4) HGE: the full model with three heterogeneous subspaces. 

% \footnote{The extraction process and protocol are attached in supplementary material. \steffen{It should be said in the `supplemental material statement' what is attached. Further notes about attachments are not necessary}}

 Table \ref{table:structural patterns} shows that models using complex space perform best on static symmetric structural patterns. Models using split-complex space performs best on temporal hierarchy pattern while models using dual space perform best on temporal star pattern. This observation supports our core assumption 
that multiple geometric spaces may benefit temporal knowledge graph representation. Moreover, TNTComplEx+HGE performs better than all variants with single geometric spaces, demonstrating that the proposed product space with temporal geometric attention mechanism could integrate the advantages of individual subspaces.

\section{HGE's Time and Space Usage}
 As HGE reuses vectors for different geometric subspaces, the increased parameters to implement an HGE module will be $2|\mathcal{R}|*d$, which is the attention weights for two proposed attention mechanisms. We demonstrate the HGE's efficiency by comparing the number of parameters and running times of the original backbone with HGE-extended backbones. All models are trained with 200 epochs and we calculate the average running time of training epochs for each model. From Table \ref{table:time and space}, we observe that with the same embedding dimension $d$=1200 for entities and relations, the increased number of parameters and running time are rather moderate for HGE-extensions. Specifically, when TNTComplEx is extended by HGE, its performance is comparable to TLT-KGE with only half as many parameters and a shorter running time. Even if we decrease $d$ of TNTComplEx+HGE to 1100, it still outperforms backbone TNTComplEx($d$=1200) with fewer parameter numbers. This demonstrates that HGE's improvements do not come from the increased number of parameters, but rather from its representational approach.

\section{Baseline Selection}
\label{sec:baseline selection}
\paragraph{LCGE} We found out the commonsense reasoning score introduced in equation 11 of LCGE\cite{niu2022logic} was considered during the training time but missed during the test time, which causes bias to final scores and rankings. We re-implemented the codes and attached our implementation in the supplementary material's code/LCGE\_new folder. Table \ref{table:lcge} shows the comparison of reported results in \cite{niu2022logic} and results by our implementation. 

\paragraph{DyERNIE} We do not include the baseline of DyERNIE\cite{han2020dyernie} since this paper reports the results using the static filtered setting. Moreover, the code released by the authors is not complete to implement hyperbolic spaces, making it hard to report time-aware filtering results.

\paragraph{HSAE} HSAE\cite{ren2023hierarchical} adopts a hierarchy self-attention mechanism to incorporate information from different time shots. We do not include the baseline of HSAE because the author does not publish the codes.
