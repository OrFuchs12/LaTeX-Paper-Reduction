\label{def:sep5.3-normal-form-graph-with-tree}
A tree $T$ on $\sG$ is 
in
\emph{normal form} if all of the following hold:
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]

    \item \label{def:sep5.3c-unique-systems-and-paths}
    (\systemsAndPathsUniquenessForDef) 
    A node $N$ in $T$ can only be in multiple paths $p^1,..., p^k$ of systems in the tree, if splitting $N$ into $\{N,N'\}$ via \cref{le:21may19.2-CID-hom-from-node-copying-and-deleting} and obtaining $T'$ from $T$ by replacing $N$ with $N'$ in one of those paths would make $T'$ no longer a tree of systems.

    \item (no-backdoor-infopaths) \label{def:sep5.3b-appropriate-tree}
    Every system $s$ in $T$ has an info path that starts with an outgoing link from $X^s$. 

    \item (\noRedundantLinks) \label{def:sep5.3e-no-redundant-links}
    If $N \to N'$ is an edge to a non-decision $N'$, where 
    one of $N$ and $N'$ is in a path in a system of $T$, 
    not including the nodes of the root information link, 
    then $N \to N'$ is in a path of a system of $T$.~\looseness=-1
