A \emph{tree of systems} on an ID graph $\calG$ is a tuple $T=(\calS,\spred)$ where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $\calS = (s^0,...,s^k)$ is a list of systems (which may include duplicates).
    
    \item $\spred$ maps each $s^i$ to a pair $(s^j,p)$, 
    where $s^j\in (\calS\setminus\{s^i\})$ is a system, %
    $p$ is one of the paths of $s^j$ (info, control, or obs), and
    $\sinfolink^{s^i}$ is in the path $p$,
    except there is a unique ``root system'' $\ssRoot$ that is mapped to $(\ssRoot,``\snone")$.
\end{itemize}
Moreover, a \emph{full tree of systems} is one where for each information link $X' \to D'$ in each path $p$ in each system $s$, there is precisely one system $s'$ whose information link equals $X' \to D'$ and with $\pred{s'}=(s,p)$.
