\ryan{VoC goes back to at least \citet{shachter1986evaluating}.
It's just this specific phrasing that's from Tom.}
\begin{restatable}[\citet{Everitt2021agent}]{definition}{defvoc}
Let $(\calG, P)$ be a CIM with a chance node $X \in \sX$,
and let $\Pi$ be the set of policies.
Then the \emph{value of control} of $X$ is:
    \[
    \max_{\spi \in \Pi}\max_{g^X} \EE_\spi[\totutilvar|do(X=g^X(\pa_x))]
    -
    \max_{\spi \in \Pi} \EE_\spi[\totutilvar]
\]
where $g^X$ is a soft intervention at $X$, i.e.\ a new CPD for $X$ that respects the graph.
