    \label{def:cim}
    An \emph{influence diagram} (ID) is  a tuple $\calM = (\sG, \dom, P)$ where $\sG$ is an ID graph, $\dom(X)$ is a finite domain for each node $X$ in $\sG$ that is real-valued for utility nodes, and $P( X | \Pa(X))$ is a conditional probability distribution (CPD) for each chance and utility node $X$ in $\sG$.
    We will say that $\calM$ is \emph{compatible with} $\calG$, or simply that $\calM$ is an ID \emph{on} $\calG$.~\looseness=-1
