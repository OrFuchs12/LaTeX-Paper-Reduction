    \item \textbf{(Decisions are optimal iff they perform their task)} \label{le:21jan31.3a-taskify-optimal-iff-performs-task}
    If all decisions in $\Vadded$ have optimal decision rules with a policy $\pi$, then each $D^i$ is optimal under $\pi$ iff for all $\pa \in \dom(\Pa(D^i))$, if $P_\pi(\pa) > 0$, then $\pi^{D^i}(a | \pa) = t^i(x^i)$ with probability $1$, where $x^i$ is the value of $X^i$ assigned by $\pa$.
        
        
    \item \textbf{(Added utility nodes are unaffected by the original graph)} \label{le:21jan31.3c-taskify-added-utility-nodes-unaffected}
    Let $\{\pi^D\}_{D\in \sD'}$ 
    % \ryan{I know you didn't want to, but I still think it probably makes sense for it to say $D \in \sD'$, and then for us to specify what $\sD'$ is}
    %\chris{What about this?}
    % \ryan{it's better now imo}
    be a set of optimal decision rules for $\sD'=(\sD\cap \Vadded)\cup \{D^i\}_i^k$.
    % each decision $D$ in $\MTaskify$ that is also in $\Vadded$ or is one of $D^i$.
    Let $\{g^X\}_{X\in \sX'}$  for $\sX'\subseteq \sV$
    % \ryan{Likewise for $X \in \sX'$ here.}
    be any set of soft interventions where $X$ is a node in $\calG$, such that for all $D$, 
    $P(\Pa(D)_{g^X}=\pa^D)>1$ only if $P(\Pa(D)=\pa^D)>1$. Then $U_{g^X}=U = \max_\pa f^U_{\MTaskify}(\pa)$ with probability $1$ in ${\MTaskify}$.
    
    
    \item \textbf{(The model on the original nodes is unmodified)} \label{le:21jan31.3b-taskify-original-model-unchanged}
    For all nodes $V\in \sV$, 
    $\dom_{\MTaskify}(V)=\dom_M(V)$, and for all chance and utility nodes $V\in \sV$, $f^V_{\MTaskify}=f^V_M$.
   
    
    \item \textbf{(CID Homomorphism)} \label{le:21jan31.3d-taskify-homomorphic-split}
    There is a CID homomorphism $h$ from 
    $\GTaskify=(\VTaskify,\ETaskify)$ 
    to $\sG=(\sV,E)$ that has
    $h(V)\!=\!V$ for
    every node
    $V \in \sV \cap \VTaskify$ in both graphs.
