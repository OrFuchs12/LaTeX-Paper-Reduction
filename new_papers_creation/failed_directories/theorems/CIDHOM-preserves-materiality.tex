\begin{restatable}[Preserves VoI]{lemma} {lecidhompreservesmateriality} \label{th:CID-homomorphism-preserves-Materiality}
    Let $h\colon\!\sG'\!\!\to\! \sG$ be an ID homomorphism.
    If $X'$ has positive VoI for $D'$ in an ID $\calM'$ on $\sG'$, then $X\!=\!h(X)$ has positive VoI for $D\!=\!h(D')$ in the transported ID $\calM\!=\!h(\calM')$.~\looseness=-1
\end{restatable}
\ryan{I thought materiality is defined with respect to just a model, so I've changed this statement. I think the proof should remain similar, and use transported model + policy?}
