\begin{proof}[Proof of {\cref{thm:voi}} (completeness direction)]
We know that the d-reduction $\calG^*$ of $\calG$ contains $X \to D$.
By \cref{le:20nov29.1-Existence-of-adequate-CID-split-from-nothing}, there exists an ID graph $\calG'$ 
with normal form tree rooted at a link $X' \to D'$, with an ID homomorphism from $\calG'$ to $\calG$ that has $h(X')=X$ and $h(D')=D$. 
By \cref{le:aug23.3v2-materiality-model-on-nf-tree-has-materiality}, since $\calG'$ has a normal form tree rooted at $X'\to D'$, there exists an ID on $\calG'$ in which $X'$ has positive VoI for $D'$.
By \cref{th:CID-homomorphism-preserves-Materiality}, the presence of the ID homomorphism $h$ from $\calG'$ to $\calG$
means that there also exists an ID $\calM$ on $\calG$ such that $h(X')=X$ has positive VoI for $h(D')=D$, showing the result.~\looseness=-1
