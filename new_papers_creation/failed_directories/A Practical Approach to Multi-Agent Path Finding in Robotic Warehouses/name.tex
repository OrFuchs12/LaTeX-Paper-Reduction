Dear SoCS chairs,

I was away for a few weeks and I know that this might be a little late. However, I would like to please make the following requests. I am observing the Orthodox Jewish religion. Saturday is a holly day which we are not allowed to do any work (the definition of work is complicated and not trivial). So, in practice I would like to ask that the papers that were submitted by my group will not be scheduled for an oral presentation on Saturday. In particular, I am taking about the following four papers:

1) Online Multi-Agent Path Finding: New Results. #47.

2) Meeting at the Border of Two Separate Domains. #43. 

3) Bounded Cost Bi-Objective Heuristic Search. #46.

4) Merging Agents In Multi-Agent Pathfinding #35

Can that be done?

In addition, in the registration form in the dietary restriction I asked for "Kosher". Will there be such an option? There are a number of Kosher providers in Vienna and I am happy to help out in reaching to them. For example, I am happy to communicate directly with whoever in the venue is charged on the food issue and see if we can get some Kosher meals from a Kosher provider. If this causes extra costs then I am happy to pay these costs. Roni Stern (CCed) who also will come to SoCS also has the same Kosher issues. 

Again, I know that I might be a little late here but I hope that we can work something out.
