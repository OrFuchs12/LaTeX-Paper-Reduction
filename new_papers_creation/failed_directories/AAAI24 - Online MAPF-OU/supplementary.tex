\section{Proofs}


\begin{theorem}
Given a truthful observation function, 
the Online Replanning framework is (1) sound, i.e., the plan it executes is guaranteed to avoid conflicts and obstacles if the CMAPF solver is sound; and (2) complete, i.e., if a solution exists then it will eventually be found, if the CMAPF solver is complete.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
\noindent \textbf{Soundndess.} Before performing any action, the agents observe their environment (\emph{UpdateSnapshot}). If new knowledge becomes available (line 6), we modify the policy using a sound CMAPF planner. Since O is truthful, only valid actions will be considered for an agent in the current iteration. Therefore, at any iteration, the agents execute only legal actions.\\

\noindent\textbf{Completeness.} 
    Any planning phase generates a policy considering the observed information. If CMAPF has failed to plan under the currently available knowledge, i.e, all edges $e \in \eko \cup \eao$ were exhausted, we shall include the edges that are assumed to be blocked, i.e we will apply CMAPF search on a graph $G=\langle V,  \eko \cup \eao \cup \eb \rangle $. Hence, eventually, we will uncover the true graph. As the truth graph is guaranteed to contain a solution, and any action may be reverted (G is an undirected graph), it follows that any replanning shall succeed. Thus, the while loop eventually halts.
\end{proof}



\begin{theorem}
   Given a truthful observation relation $O$ and a proximity parameter $r\ge1$ then Local Conflict Resolution is sound when using a sound CMAPF solver and complete when using a complete SMAPF solver.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
\textbf{Soundness.} Similar to Online Replanning, on any planning phase merely valid actions are considered. However, conflict resolution is deferred until it detected to occur within at most $r$ steps.
    Once such a conflict is detected, the ongoing policy is modified by a sound CMAPF planner to resolve it. As $r\ge1$ it follows that the modified ongoing policy is collision-free.\\


\noindent \textbf{Completeness}
    Local Conflict Resolution behaves similarly to Online Replanning, excluding conflicts resolution. Thus, it suffices to show that deferring collision resolution does not breach completeness. Let $\pi_1, \pi_2 \in \pi$ be a pair of colliding policies and $c$ be the earliest conflict between those policies, such that $\mbox{t}(c) \le r$. Suppose that $ReolveConflicts$ failed. It implies that there are no collision-free policies for the group containing $a_1, a_2$. In contradiction to the true graph property.
\end{proof}
