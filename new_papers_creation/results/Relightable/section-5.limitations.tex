\section{Limitations}
The network training takes about 2.5 days in total on a single RTX 3090 GPU, and it takes about 40 seconds to render an image with a resolution of $512\times 512$ during inference (more details in the supplemental document).
Integrating instant training techniques like Instant-NGP \cite{instant-ngp} may improve the efficiency of our technique.
It is still hard for our method to animate pose-dependent wrinkle deformations (especially for loose clothing) or generate global illumination effects, which are also open problems in this topic.
Our method only considers the body motion rather than the face and hands, while recent works~\cite{zheng2023avatarrex, shen2023xavatar} provide possibilities to handle them.
