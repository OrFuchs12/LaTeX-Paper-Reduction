\section{Conclusion}
This is the first work that reconstructs relightable and animatable neural avatars with plausible shadow effects from sparse human videos.
For dynamic body geometry modeling, the proposed invertible deformation field provides a novel and effective way to solve the inverse skinning problem.
Besides, the part-wise light visibility modeling solves the problem of dynamic object relighting based on neural fields.
Benefiting from the two techniques, our method succeeds in disentangling the geometry, material of the clothed body, and lighting, thus building a relightable and animatable neural avatar in a lightweight setting.
