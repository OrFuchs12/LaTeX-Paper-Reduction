We study the practical valuable task of MER and MEN.
They are fundamental tasks in medical literature mining because many developments in this area are related to these two tasks. 
Previous state-of-the-art studies have demonstrated that the mutual benefits between medical named entity recognition and normalization are very useful.
%However, these state-of-the-art joint modeling methods utilize the mutual benefits between medical named entity recognition and normalization in simple and shallow ways. 
To make use of the mutual benefits in a more advanced and intelligent way, we proposed a novel deep neural multi-task learning framework with two explicit feedback strategies to jointly model MER and MEN. Our method can convert hierarchical tasks, i.e., MER and MEN, into parallel multi-task mode while maintaining mutual supports between tasks.
%We evaluated our models across two corpora of medical articles and outperform state-of-the-art studies.
Experimental results indicate that our model outperforms previous state-of-the-art studies.
