\caption{Examples of each probing task, as well as the corresponding exact move (\exactmove) and legal move (\legalmove) correct answers, are shown below. All examples assume the language model was fed the prefix \pos{e2e4 e7e5 g1f3 b8c6 d2d4 h7h6} (see Figure~\ref{fig:move_notation}), and that the actual next move was \pos{f1b5}. While there is only one valid prompt token for both End-Actual and Start-Actual tasks, there are many valid prompt tokens for the other tasks, and we show just one possibility for each. Start-tasks (bottom sub-table) assume the model was trained on games described in UCI+RAP notation.}
