\section{SAN Notation}
\label{sec:san}
\paragraph{Standard Algebraic Notation (SAN)} combines the piece type moved and the destination square to denote a move.\footnote{For more details see \url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_notation_(chess)}}
For example, the move in Figure~\ref{fig:move_notation} is represented as \texttt{Bb5} in SAN where \texttt{B} represents the piece type bishop and \texttt{b5} represents the destination square.

\paragraph{Standard Algebraic Notation (SAN) Ambiguity}
SAN notation doesn't use the starting square of the piece in its move representation.
This limits the ability to prompt a SAN-based language model with specific piece type instances.
For example, given the prompt ``\texttt{\underline{e4 e5 Nf3 Nc6 d4 h6} B}'' (the underlined move sequence leads to the left board state in Figure~\ref{fig:move_notation}), it's not clear whether the token \texttt{B} refers to the bishop at \texttt{f1} or \texttt{c1}. Due to this limitation on the specificity of probing queries, we do not use SAN for our experiments.

\section{Model Vocabulary}

Table~\ref{tab:model_vocab} shows the vocabulary used. 
No delimiter token is used to denote the move boundary. 
Tokens of promoted pawn piece type are used when a pawn gets promoted.
For example, \pos{e7e8q} denotes the move where a pawn from e7 moves to e8 and becomes a queen.
