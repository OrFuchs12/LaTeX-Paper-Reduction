Review:	This paper presents PP-LAMA algorithm which is GPPP extended by several heuristics. These heuristics were successfully used in centralized planning and it definitely worth to investigate their use in multi-agent settings. PP-LAMA outperforms other multi-agent planners and overall performs very well on the CoDMAP benchmark set.

The article is readable although it contains many minor errors, unclear definitions and typos. Please use a native speaker to proofread the article.

The only thing I'm really missing is more clear definition of CPPP - especially its privacy preserving part. It should be clearly stated that presented algorithms protect the private information only by obfuscation (which is equivalent to defining ID for each private part) and thus it still can be detected for example how many internal states each agent has and how they are connected by internal actions.

Since you run all the experiments on a single computer, can you add results of centralized FF-LAMA for the same problems? I suppose that PP-LAMA should approach FF-LAMA values very closely. Is it right?

Minor errors and typos:

Sec. 2.1
- are the public ACTIONS of agent 
- a set of facts and actions MARKED (?) as private
- definition of private_i is too vague
- missing: private_i(P) \cap public(P) = \emptyset
\bigcup private_i(P) \cup public(P) = P

- to achieve the PRIVATE preconditions
- one company does not want to - which one? => no company wants to
- public, (where) WHILE the move 

Sec. 2.2
- must be satisfied during the execution - at some point of execution (your sentence souns like it has to be satisfied during the whole execution)
- to be achieveD
- landmarks(,) searches (no comma)
- ignoring delete effects - delete effects are not defined

Sec. 2.3
- whose precondition (is) ARE satisfied
- Then, all the facts in these actionsâ€™ effects are added to the next layer, ignoring delete effects. REFORMULATE


Sec. 2.4 
- is there proof that GPPP is CPPP?
- When a state s (missing space) is expanded
- the agent generateS new
- the AGENT can execute

Sec. 3
- \phi_{pub} represents multiple facts while \phi_i represents a single facts - inconsistent notation

Review:	The paper proposes an adaptation of the LAMA planner to collaborative privacy preserving planning (CPPP), called PP-LAMA (Privacy Preserving LAMA), which is an extension of the GPPP planner, now including privacy preserving
versions of the FF heuristic, the landmark heuristic, preferred operators and deferred heuristic evaluation. The proposed planner, PP-LAMA, is shown to coverage-wise outperform all relevant planners from the CoDMAP'15 competition.

The presentation of results in the paper is concise, and the empirical results are convincing, however it would be interesting to see not only coverage-wise comparisons, but also IPC score related comparisons, runtime, memory usage, etc.

The paper could also emphasize / clarify more, that it focuses on centralized MAP, and not distributed MAP. This affects also Section 4 (Empirical Evaluation), where it is not clearly indicated, that the benchmarks were taken from the centralized track of CoDMAP'15. Also the competition could be referred to properly by referring to a respective publication detailing it or at least a URL to its website.

The conclusions and future work sections of the paper are quite lightweight at the moment. It would be interesting to read a little about how the proposed planner could cope with more realistic MAP descriptions, beyond MA-STRIPS. How straightforward would it be to extend it to cope with typical PDDL features (numeric state-fluents, conditional effects, etc.)? Could the planner be implemented in a distributed fashion?
