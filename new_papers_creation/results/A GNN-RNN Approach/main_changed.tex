\begin{abstract}
Climate change is posing new challenges to crop-related concerns, including food insecurity, supply stability, and economic planning. Accurately predicting crop yields is crucial for addressing these challenges. However, this prediction task is exceptionally complicated since crop yields depend on numerous factors such as weather, land surface, and soil quality, as well as their interactions. In recent years, machine learning models have been successfully applied in this domain. However, these models either restrict their tasks to a relatively small region, or only study over a single or few years, which makes them hard to generalize spatially and temporally. In this paper, we introduce a novel graph-based recurrent neural network for crop yield prediction, to incorporate both geographical and temporal knowledge in the model, and further boost predictive power. Our method is trained, validated, and tested on over 2000 counties from 41 states in the US mainland, covering years from 1981 to 2019. As far as we know, this is the first machine learning method that embeds geographical knowledge in crop yield prediction and predicts crop yields at the county level nationwide. We also laid a solid foundation by comparing our model on a nationwide scale with other well-known baseline methods, including linear models, tree-based models, and deep learning methods. Experiments show that our proposed method consistently outperforms the existing state-of-the-art methods on various metrics, validating the effectiveness of geospatial and temporal information.

%Climate change is posing new challenges to crop-related concerns including food insecurity, supply stability and economic planning. As one of the central challenges, crop yield prediction has become a pressing task in the machine learning field. Despite its importance, the prediction task is exceptionally complicated since crop yields depend on various factors such as weather, land surface, soil quality as well as their interactions. In recent years, machine learning models have shown many successful applications in the crop domain. However, these models either restrict their tasks to a relatively small region, or only span over a single or few years, which makes them hard to generalize spatially and temporally. In this paper, we present a new crop yield dataset comprising of plenteous weather, land, soil variables across over 3000 counties from all 48 states in the US mainland, covering years from 1981 to 2019. As far as we know, this is the first nationwide dataset with such a long time span in the crop domain for machine learning. On this dataset, we lay a solid foundation for machine learning tasks by applying well-known linear models, tree-based models, deep learning methods and comparing their performance. Moreover, we introduce a novel graph-based recurrent neural network for crop yield prediction, to incorporate both geographical and temporal knowledge in the model, and further boost the predictive power.
