    \caption{Time vs. ImageNet zero-shot performance analysis for Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining with existing ViT accleration framework (EViT).
    We compare the results between EViT directly applied on CLIP and EViT trained with our proposed meta-architecture, ECLIPSE.
    Our proposed framework enables even streamlined ViTs with 101\% faster throughputs to outperform the full ViT of CLIP.
    Model performance and inference time are measured with ViT-B/16 backbone.
